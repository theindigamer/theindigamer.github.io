<h2>Intended audience</h2>
<p>This post is pri&shy;mar&shy;i&shy;ly aimed at un&shy;der&shy;grad&shy;u&shy;ate se&shy;niors who will be
ap&shy;ply&shy;ing for ad&shy;mis&shy;sion to a PhD pro&shy;gram in the US. While some grad&shy;u&shy;ate
schools al&shy;so of&shy;fer M.S. de&shy;grees (ei&shy;ther course-based or the&shy;sis-based), I
do not have first-hand ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence of ap&shy;ply&shy;ing for such a pro&shy;gram.
How&shy;ev&shy;er, some ba&shy;sic tips for writ&shy;ing a state&shy;ment of pur&shy;pose, prep&shy;ping
for stan&shy;dard&shy;ized tests, get&shy;ting let&shy;ters of rec&shy;om&shy;men&shy;da&shy;tion etc. car&shy;ry
over with lit&shy;tle to no mod&shy;i&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion for an M.S. ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion, es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly
for a the&shy;sis-based pro&shy;gram.</p>
<p>Al&shy;though I ap&shy;plied to PhD pro&shy;grams in physics, I have at&shy;tempt&shy;ed to keep
the ad&shy;vice gen&shy;er&shy;al in&shy;stead of be&shy;ing spe&shy;cif&shy;ic to physics ap&shy;pli&shy;cants.
These notes are ba&shy;si&shy;cal&shy;ly a con&shy;densed ver&shy;sion of all the stuff that I
wish I’d known at the very be&shy;gin&shy;ning of the ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion pe&shy;ri&shy;od.</p>
<p>As with most things on the in&shy;ter&shy;net, take the fol&shy;low&shy;ing ad&shy;vice with a
grain of salt. I have based it on the stuff I’ve read and done, but
YM&shy;MV.</p>
<section id="additional-resources-if-you-re-tired-of-my-writing-already">
<h3>Additional resources (if you’re tired of my writing already)</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>`Acad.SE &lt;https://academia.stack&shy;ex&shy;change.com&gt;`__</strong> - There are
al&shy;ready a large num&shy;ber of ques&shy;tions about grad&shy;u&shy;ate ad&shy;mis&shy;sions that
have been an&shy;swered by aca&shy;demics. If you are fa&shy;mil&shy;iar with
Stack&shy;Over&shy;flow or AskUbun&shy;tu, think of academia.stack&shy;ex&shy;change as a
cousin in the same fam&shy;i&shy;ly. Don’t for&shy;get to take the site tour first.</li>
<li><strong>`/r/GradAd&shy;mis&shy;sions &lt;https://www.red&shy;dit.com/r/gradad&shy;mis&shy;sions&gt;`__</strong> -
A more in&shy;for&shy;mal place to ask ques&shy;tions. The mix of ap&shy;pli&shy;cants and
aca&shy;demics is a bit dif&shy;fer&shy;ent from Acad.SE. Over&shy;all, it al&shy;so seems to
have less&shy;er par&shy;tic&shy;i&shy;pa&shy;tion. Check out the side&shy;bar for im&shy;por&shy;tant links.</li>
<li><strong>Ad&shy;mis&shy;sions of&shy;fices</strong> - If you feel that the in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion avail&shy;able
on the uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty web&shy;site is in&shy;suf&shy;fi&shy;cient, or you find the word&shy;ing
un&shy;clear, con&shy;tact the ad&shy;mis&shy;sions of&shy;fice of the rel&shy;e&shy;vant
de&shy;part&shy;ment/col&shy;lege. I’ve most&shy;ly had pos&shy;i&shy;tive ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ences with replies
but the re&shy;sponse times can vary dras&shy;ti&shy;cal&shy;ly from of&shy;fice to of&shy;fice, so
send emails as soon as you can.</li>
<li><strong>Your se&shy;niors</strong> - For lit&shy;tle bits and pieces of ad&shy;vice which are not
avail&shy;able on the web, talk&shy;ing to se&shy;niors is in&shy;valu&shy;able. More
im&shy;por&shy;tant&shy;ly, if you have ac&shy;cess to more than a few da&shy;ta points, the
map&shy;ping be&shy;tween cre&shy;den&shy;tials and grad school can give you a good idea
of where you should and shouldn’t ap&shy;ply. While com&shy;par&shy;ing cre&shy;den&shy;tials
across uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties is fair&shy;ly dif&shy;fi&shy;cult, you <em>can</em> rough&shy;ly com&shy;pare
your own with those of your se&shy;niors at the time of ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion.</li>
<li><strong>Your pro&shy;fes&shy;sors</strong> - If you are par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ed in some
sub&shy;fields, talk to pro&shy;fes&shy;sors in your de&shy;part&shy;ment work&shy;ing in re&shy;lat&shy;ed
ar&shy;eas. They can point you in the right di&shy;rec&shy;tion for pa&shy;pers and
re&shy;search groups which will help you in the pre-ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion phase.</li>
<li><strong>`The Grad Cafe &lt;http://fo&shy;rum.the&shy;grad&shy;cafe.com/&gt;`__</strong> - Fair&shy;ly use&shy;ful
for know&shy;ing cre&shy;den&shy;tials of stu&shy;dents ad&shy;mit&shy;ted to dif&shy;fer&shy;ent
uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties. Scour&shy;ing the web&shy;site will yield many ad&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al da&shy;ta
points com&shy;pared to just talk&shy;ing to se&shy;niors. You can al&shy;so talk to
oth&shy;er ap&shy;pli&shy;cants in the fo&shy;rums.</li>

<h2>Stuff you’ll need</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>A friend in deed</strong> - You can pro&shy;vide help each oth&shy;er in mul&shy;ti&shy;ple
ways: proof-read&shy;ing and giv&shy;ing feed&shy;back on SOPs, study&shy;ing to&shy;geth&shy;er
for tests, scout&shy;ing for uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties etc.</li>
<li><strong>Dili&shy;gence</strong> - The whole ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion process takes a lot of time and
en&shy;er&shy;gy, es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly scout&shy;ing and get&shy;ting your first SOP ready. It is
bet&shy;ter to spread your tasks over a few weeks/months and start
sub&shy;mit&shy;ting ear&shy;ly in&shy;stead of aim&shy;ing to sub&shy;mit ev&shy;ery&shy;thing right be&shy;fore
the dead&shy;line.</li>
<li><strong>Com&shy;mon sense</strong> - For ex&shy;am&shy;ple, reg&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly back&shy;up all your ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion
doc&shy;u&shy;ments; cloud sync&shy;ing makes this es&shy;pe&shy;cial&shy;ly easy. Keep a sep&shy;a&shy;rate
check&shy;list of ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion doc&shy;u&shy;ments for each uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty and keep it
up&shy;dat&shy;ed as you up&shy;load stuff. Don’t for&shy;get to note all the dead&shy;lines
in the same check&shy;list. I have al&shy;so sprin&shy;kled a bit of com&shy;mon sense
ad&shy;vice through&shy;out this ar&shy;ti&shy;cle, just in case.</li>
<li><strong>A thor&shy;ough un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing of … your&shy;self</strong> - You need to un&shy;der&shy;stand
what is im&shy;por&shy;tant for you and what is not. Do you have any food
re&shy;stric&shy;tions? Is the lo&shy;ca&shy;tion – say city ver&shy;sus col&shy;lege town –
im&shy;por&shy;tant for you? What stan&shy;dard of liv&shy;ing would you be okay with? A
large chunk of your time will be spent just in mak&shy;ing de&shy;ci&shy;sions;
fig&shy;ur&shy;ing out your pri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ties be&shy;fore&shy;hand is cru&shy;cial to the process.</li>

<p>Most uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties have fall ad&shy;mis&shy;sions. Some ac&shy;cept ap&shy;pli&shy;cants for

<p>While most uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties have dead&shy;lines around 15 De&shy;cem&shy;ber or 15 Jan&shy;u&shy;ary,

<section id="scouting-a-k-a-how-to-go-mad-step-1">
<h2>Scouting a.k.a. how to go mad step 1</h2>
<p>The process of scout&shy;ing is ex&shy;treme&shy;ly time-con&shy;sum&shy;ing. You have to ar&shy;rive
at a short&shy;list of 5~10 schools which you will ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly ap&shy;ply&shy;ing to out
of po&shy;ten&shy;tial 50~100 uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties. The lim&shy;it&shy;ing fac&shy;tors for ap&shy;ply&shy;ing to a
larg&shy;er num&shy;ber of uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties are your time, san&shy;i&shy;ty and mon&shy;ey (not
nec&shy;es&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;ly in that or&shy;der). If you are ap&shy;ply&shy;ing to say 8 uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties,
then I would sug&shy;gest the fol&shy;low&shy;ing break-down:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>2/3 top schools - You feel that you have a low chance of be&shy;ing
se&shy;lect&shy;ed be&shy;cause your cre&shy;den&shy;tials seem weak&shy;er com&shy;pared to past years’
ad&shy;mits.</li>
<li>3 “mid&shy;dle” schools - You feel that you have a mod&shy;er&shy;ate chance of
be&shy;ing se&shy;lect&shy;ed be&shy;cause your cre&shy;den&shy;tials are rough&shy;ly sim&shy;i&shy;lar to past
years’ ad&shy;mits.</li>
<li>3/2 back&shy;up schools - You feel that you have a very good chance of
be&shy;ing se&shy;lect&shy;ed be&shy;cause your cre&shy;den&shy;tials are much bet&shy;ter than those of
past years’ ad&shy;mits.</li>
</ul>
<p>As men&shy;tioned ear&shy;li&shy;er, un&shy;der&shy;stand&shy;ing your pri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ties is key to de&shy;cid&shy;ing
where to ap&shy;ply. Do&shy;ing so be&shy;fore ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly be&shy;gin&shy;ning scout&shy;ing is bet&shy;ter
than fig&shy;ur&shy;ing out things on the fly and then go&shy;ing back to re-eval&shy;u&shy;ate
uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties us&shy;ing your new cri&shy;te&shy;ria.</p>
<p>While look&shy;ing at par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar re&shy;search groups is im&shy;por&shy;tant, you should
al&shy;so look at the de&shy;part&shy;ment as a whole, lest your re&shy;search in&shy;ter&shy;ests
change be&shy;tween get&shy;ting ad&shy;mit&shy;ted and ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly start&shy;ing re&shy;search.</p>
<p>Apart from per&shy;son&shy;al pref&shy;er&shy;ences, you should con&shy;sid&shy;er the fol&shy;low&shy;ing
fac&shy;tors (PI = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_investigator">Prin&shy;ci&shy;pal
In&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tor</a>):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Match of re&shy;search in&shy;ter&shy;ests (PI) - You <em>must</em> read pa&shy;pers here. The
in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;to&shy;ry in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion giv&shy;en on pro&shy;fes&shy;sors’ web&shy;pages should on&shy;ly be
used as a pre-fil&shy;ter.</li>
<li>Past PhD stu&shy;dents (PI) - Did they at&shy;tend con&shy;fer&shy;ences and pub&shy;lish
reg&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly dur&shy;ing the PhD? Were all pa&shy;pers pub&shy;lished joint&shy;ly with the
ad&shy;vi&shy;sor? Where are they work&shy;ing now?</li>
<li>Re&shy;search fa&shy;cil&shy;i&shy;ties (dept.) - Do the groups have easy ac&shy;cess to good
com&shy;put&shy;ing or ex&shy;per&shy;i&shy;men&shy;tal fa&shy;cil&shy;i&shy;ties?</li>
<li>Fund&shy;ing: Do most grad&shy;u&shy;ate stu&shy;dents re&shy;ceive TAs/RAs ini&shy;tial&shy;ly? Once
you’ve start&shy;ed work&shy;ing on your the&shy;sis project, do you still need to
TA?</li>
<li>Where PhD stu&shy;dents fi&shy;nal&shy;ly end up (dept., not debt) - Com&shy;pare this
with your own ca&shy;reer goals.</li>
<li>Typ&shy;i&shy;cal PhD com&shy;ple&shy;tion time (dept.) - A com&shy;ple&shy;tion time around 5~6
years is typ&shy;i&shy;cal (in physics).</li>
<li>Course&shy;work (dept.) - Are there a lot of com&shy;pul&shy;so&shy;ry cour&shy;ses? Are there
a va&shy;ri&shy;ety of elec&shy;tives?</li>
<li>Se&shy;lec&shy;tiv&shy;i&shy;ty (dept.) - What is the ad&shy;mit rate for ap&shy;pli&shy;cants? In
physics, ~8% would be high&shy;ly se&shy;lec&shy;tive.</li>
<li>Work at&shy;mos&shy;phere (dept./PI) - If you can con&shy;tact a cur&shy;rent grad
stu&shy;dent, ask about in&shy;tan&shy;gi&shy;bles such as sense of com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;ty,
friend&shy;li&shy;ness etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the scout&shy;ing process, you should have a pri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ty
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28graph_theory%29">tree</a>
(ide&shy;al&shy;ly a list) at hand.</p>
<p>There is a nice meta post on Acad.SE ti&shy;tled “<a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/66926/ive-been-admitted-to-multiple-phd-programs-how-should-i-choose-between-them">I’ve been ad&shy;mit&shy;ted to
mul&shy;ti&shy;ple PhD pro&shy;grams, how should I choose be&shy;tween
them?</a>”.
How&shy;ev&shy;er, it al&shy;so sum&shy;ma&shy;rizes the in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion that you should keep in mind
while se&shy;lect&shy;ing uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties you should ap&shy;ply to.</p>

<section id="standardized-tests-and-standard-subheadings">
<h2>Standardized tests (and standard subheadings)</h2>
<p>Most US uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties re&shy;quire TOE&shy;FL and GRE scores, both of which are
con&shy;duct&shy;ed by <a href="https://www.ets.org">ETS</a>. Make sure that you have
short&shy;list&shy;ed at least 4 uni&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ties be&shy;fore reg&shy;is&shy;ter&shy;ing for the GRE, as
you can send scores to them for “free.” AFAIK, these tests are avail&shy;able
on&shy;ly in an on&shy;line for&shy;mat (in In&shy;dia) so make sure your typ&shy;ing speed is up
to snuff as you’ll be re&shy;quired to write short es&shy;says dur&shy;ing the tests.</p>
<p>De&shy;pend&shy;ing on your field, you might al&shy;so have to give a GRE sub&shy;ject test.
There are al&shy;so 4 “free” score re&shy;ports for the GRE Sub&shy;ject test. All in
all, you have to give at most 3 tests, as&shy;sum&shy;ing you do well on your
first at&shy;tempt.</p>
<p><strong>Dis&shy;claimer</strong>: This in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion is based on my ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence for the GRE
Physics Sub&shy;ject test and may not ac&shy;cu&shy;rate&shy;ly re&shy;flect on the prepa&shy;ra&shy;tion
re&shy;quired for oth&shy;er Sub&shy;ject tests. Al&shy;so, I was fair&shy;ly well-pre&shy;pared for
the GRE Gen&shy;er&shy;al test be&shy;fore ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly start&shy;ing for&shy;mal prepa&shy;ra&shy;tions (I
ob&shy;tained ~320/340 on my first prac&shy;tice test with ze&shy;ro prep).</p>
<p><strong>Be&shy;fore you start prep!</strong> Write 1 prac&shy;tice pa&shy;per for each test at the
very be&shy;gin&shy;ning. Now you know where your weak&shy;ness&shy;es lie and you can start
pre&shy;par&shy;ing in a fo&shy;cused (or fo&shy;cussed :P) man&shy;ner in&shy;stead of just blind&shy;ly
fol&shy;low&shy;ing some&shy;body’s ad&shy;vice.</p>

(ev&shy;i&shy;dence, counter-ar&shy;gu&shy;ment…) and ar&shy;ti&shy;cle (in&shy;tent…). Read ETS’s
web&shy;site for more de&shy;tails.</p>
<p>The best way to pre&shy;pare for this sec&shy;tion is prac&shy;tice (duh!). I rec&shy;om&shy;mend
us&shy;ing ETS’s of&shy;fi&shy;cial book for prac&shy;tice, af&shy;ter you’ve looked at the
ex&shy;am&shy;ples on their web&shy;site, as the ma&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;al is fair&shy;ly close in spir&shy;it to
the ac&shy;tu&shy;al test. Your pri&shy;or&shy;i&shy;ty should be to do of&shy;fi&shy;cial ma&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;al first.</p>
<p>For word lists, take any app of your choice which has var&shy;i&shy;ous lev&shy;els of
dif&shy;fi&shy;cul&shy;ty (I used the free ver&shy;sion of Ma&shy;goosh). Prac&shy;tice reg&shy;u&shy;lar&shy;ly. You
might find new words dif&shy;fi&shy;cult to mem&shy;o&shy;rize in some cas&shy;es. I strong&shy;ly
sug&shy;gest us&shy;ing <a href="http://ankisrs.net/">An&shy;ki</a> for these words. An&shy;ki is a
spaced rep&shy;e&shy;ti&shy;tion soft&shy;ware
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">SRS</a>), which
al&shy;lows you to cre&shy;ate and <em>in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent&shy;ly</em> sched&shy;ule
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">flash&shy;cards</a>, which can be
synced across mul&shy;ti&shy;ple de&shy;vices. Pos&shy;si&shy;ble flash&shy;card tem&shy;plate: ques&shy;tion =
word, and an&shy;swer = (mean&shy;ing, ex&shy;am&shy;ple sen&shy;tence). The An&shy;ki doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion
is fair&shy;ly well writ&shy;ten and there is a nice, (cur&shy;rent&shy;ly) free ebook
called <a href="https://alexvermeer.com/anki-essentials/">An&shy;ki Es&shy;sen&shy;tials</a> by
Alex Ver&shy;meer if you don’t like read&shy;ing doc&shy;u&shy;men&shy;ta&shy;tion.</p>

<section id="analytical-writing">
<h4>Analytical Writing</h4>
<p>This sec&shy;tion has two parts (i) writ&shy;ing a small es&shy;say from a short prompt
and (ii) dis&shy;sec&shy;tion/anal&shy;y&shy;sis of a giv&shy;en piece. The ETS web&shy;site has
sev&shy;er&shy;al writ&shy;ing ex&shy;am&shy;ples – with scor&shy;ing and the ra&shy;tio&shy;nale be&shy;hind it –
as well as a big pool of top&shy;ics.</p>
<p>As ear&shy;li&shy;er, the best way to pre&shy;pare is prac&shy;tice; here, the
afore&shy;men&shy;tioned “dili&shy;gent friend” should come in handy to cor&shy;rect your
re&shy;spons&shy;es :P. Make sure that you get suf&shy;fi&shy;cient typ&shy;ing prac&shy;tice. For
top&shy;ics, I sug&shy;gest us&shy;ing ETS’s pool as a pri&shy;ma&shy;ry source.</p>
<p>One pos&shy;si&shy;ble ap&shy;proach for the writ&shy;ing tasks is to brain&shy;storm on a piece
of pa&shy;per for ~3-5 min&shy;utes be&shy;fore start&shy;ing the es&shy;say. Dur&shy;ing this time,
you can de&shy;cide on the ba&shy;sic struc&shy;ture of your re&shy;sponse, make sure that
the ar&shy;gu&shy;ments flow log&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly, iden&shy;ti&shy;fy the points to be em&shy;pha&shy;sized etc.
While gen&shy;er&shy;al writ&shy;ing tips and strate&shy;gies ap&shy;ply here, IMO, it is
ad&shy;vis&shy;able to mod&shy;el your re&shy;spons&shy;es in the style of those of&shy;fi&shy;cial&shy;ly
marked 5/6 or 6/6 by ETS.</p>
<p>Avoid us&shy;ing key&shy;board short&shy;cuts for copy+paste to re&shy;order your re&shy;sponse
dur&shy;ing prac&shy;tice. In my ex&shy;pe&shy;ri&shy;ence, these didn’t work with ETS’s test&shy;ing
soft&shy;ware (which is sim&shy;i&shy;lar to that on their web&shy;site), but there are
on-screen but&shy;tons for the same, which are some&shy;what in&shy;con&shy;ve&shy;nient. Hit&shy;ting
Ctrl-Z (un&shy;do) al&shy;so does not work if you make some mis&shy;take here. I can’t
re&shy;call if there is a but&shy;ton for it in the soft&shy;ware.</p>

<h4>Quantitative Aptitude</h4>
<p>The syl&shy;labus for this sec&shy;tion very rough&shy;ly cor&shy;re&shy;sponds to math from

<h4>Practice tests</h4>
<p>Com&shy;plete prac&shy;tice tests at reg&shy;u&shy;lar in&shy;ter&shy;vals to as&shy;sess your progress. I
sug&shy;gest com&shy;plet&shy;ing 5-6 tests over&shy;all (more if you aren’t hit&shy;ting your

re-check&shy;ing your an&shy;swers twice or thrice if you fin&shy;ish a sec&shy;tion ahead
of time – even if you are ter&shy;ri&shy;bly bored or lazy – for ob&shy;vi&shy;ous
rea&shy;sons. For the writ&shy;ing sec&shy;tion in par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar, I sug&shy;gest se&shy;lect&shy;ing a
ran&shy;dom top&shy;ic from ETS’s pool in&shy;stead of the one in the ques&shy;tion pa&shy;per.</p>
<p>Af&shy;ter test&shy;ing is over, take a short break and com&shy;plete grad&shy;ing. For
max&shy;i&shy;mum ef&shy;fi&shy;cien&shy;cy, it is im&shy;por&shy;tant to an&shy;a&shy;lyse your mis&shy;takes and use
them for tar&shy;get&shy;ed study.</p>
<p>Here, in con&shy;trast to the in&shy;di&shy;vid&shy;u&shy;al sec&shy;tions, I sug&shy;gest sav&shy;ing the
of&shy;fi&shy;cial ETS ma&shy;te&shy;ri&shy;al – they have free soft&shy;ware on their site and a
prac&shy;tice book as well – for the last, when your prepa&shy;ra&shy;tion is 100%
com&shy;plete. In prin&shy;ci&shy;ple, these tests should give you the best es&shy;ti&shy;mate
for your score on test day.</p>

<h3>TOEFL</h3>
<p>The TOE&shy;FL should be a piece of cake if you’ve pre&shy;pared well for the GRE.
Two ad&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al sec&shy;tions on the TOE&shy;FL which do not have equiv&shy;a&shy;lents on
the GRE are the Lis&shy;ten&shy;ing and Speak&shy;ing sec&shy;tions.</p>
<p>For the Lis&shy;ten&shy;ing sec&shy;tion, note down the im&shy;por&shy;tant points men&shy;tioned in

ev&shy;ery&shy;thing down) plus those on your pa&shy;per should rough&shy;ly form a com&shy;plete
rep&shy;re&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion of what you heard. Al&shy;so, lis&shy;ten care&shy;ful&shy;ly, as the au&shy;dio
will not be re&shy;peat&shy;ed.</p>
<p>IIRC, the Speak&shy;ing sec&shy;tion al&shy;so gives in&shy;for&shy;ma&shy;tion us&shy;ing au&shy;dio, so the

less thing to wor&shy;ry about.</p>
<p>On test day, re&shy;lax. Don’t fret too much. Vis&shy;it the toi&shy;let be&shy;fore the
test and dur&shy;ing breaks. Bring some food and wa&shy;ter to the test cen&shy;tre.

<h2>A series of hopefully fortunate events</h2>
<p>Un&shy;doubt&shy;ed&shy;ly, the most nerve-wrack&shy;ing part of the whole ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tion
process is wait&shy;ing for ad&shy;mis&shy;sion de&shy;ci&shy;sions. De&shy;pend&shy;ing on your
tem&shy;per&shy;a&shy;ment, you might find your&shy;self stuck in “wait&shy;ing mode.” Symp&shy;toms
in&shy;clude but are not re&shy;strict&shy;ed to check&shy;ing your email with an un&shy;healthy
fre&shy;quen&shy;cy, find&shy;ing your at&shy;ten&shy;tion drift&shy;ing away re&shy;peat&shy;ed&shy;ly, day-dream&shy;ing
dur&shy;ing lec&shy;tures, al&shy;ways feel&shy;ing sleepy and con&shy;sis&shy;tent&shy;ly fall&shy;ing short of
time for the small&shy;est tasks.</p>
<p>If you sub&shy;mit&shy;ted your ap&shy;pli&shy;ca&shy;tions well be&shy;fore the dead&shy;lines, chances
are that you might get a pos&shy;i&shy;tive re&shy;ply ear&shy;ly; this will help you fo&shy;cus
on the tasks at hand rather than be&shy;ing stuck in wait&shy;ing mode. How&shy;ev&shy;er,
if you do find your&shy;self stuck, then best of luck and may the Force be
with you.</p>
<p>Al&shy;so, I sug&shy;gest read&shy;ing “Sur&shy;viv&shy;ing Your Stupid, Stupid De&shy;ci&shy;sion to Go to
Grad School” by Adam Ruben in the mean&shy;time. You can have a chuck&shy;le or
two and a bunch of “what if” ques&shy;tions that might put you in a small
ex&shy;is&shy;ten&shy;tial cri&shy;sis (good prepa&shy;ra&shy;tion!). If that is not enough, I
strong&shy;ly rec&shy;om&shy;mend <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php">PhD Comics</a>.</p>
<p>Fi&shy;nal&shy;ly, as you get a pos&shy;i&shy;tive re&shy;ply from some&shy;where (you didn’t skip
over the back&shy;up schools part, did you?), you can jump with joy (re&shy;lief?)
for a few mo&shy;ments and tell your fam&shy;i&shy;ly, friends and Face&shy;book friends and
switch back to wait&shy;ing mode for bet&shy;ter de&shy;ci&shy;sions ;-).</p>
