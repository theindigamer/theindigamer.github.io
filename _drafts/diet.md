Wikipedia defines "a Healthy diet" (after redirecting you from "Balanced diet") as

> A healthy diet is one that helps to maintain or improve overall health.

> A **healthy diet** provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, adequate essential amino acids from protein,[1] essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and adequate calories. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods. A healthy diet supports energy needs and provides for human nutrition without exposure to toxicity or excessive weight gain from consuming excessive amounts.

In simpler terms, it is probably the same as saying that a healthy diet gives you all the required stuff (here nutrients and energy) without making you ill, dead or fat. Taking this simplified view, let me suggest one vague definition of a balanced gaming diet: "it makes you feel all the required stuff (???) without making you ill, dead or fat."

You might think that the "required stuff" (and the nebulous ??? following it) doesn't seem to make much sense. In the case of health, it is fairly clear what is required; nutrients and energy. Is there a list of stuff that you should feel as a person? Is there an obligation on games to make you feel stuff from such a list?

### Maslow's Hierarchy and Games

Maslow's hierarchy[^hierarchy] -- also known as Maslow's pyramid -- describes different types of motivation and their relative importance for an individual. In increasing order of importance, these are (i) Physiological needs, (ii) Safety needs, (iii) Love and belonging, (iv) Esteem and (v) Self-actualization. In the following sections, I'll try to describe each of these in more detail and try to give examples of games which try to address these needs.

[^hierarchy]: I'd like to credit The Sims 3's loading screen for acquainting me with Maslow's hierarchy. Also, I understand that Maslow's hierarchy has had a bunch of criticism but I have used it for two reasons (i) it is fairly simple to understand at a basic level and (ii) I am not too familiar with alternative theories of needs.

#### Physiological Needs

#### Safety Needs

#### Love and Belonging

#### Esteem

#### Self-actualization and metamotivation

#### Do all games fit well into these sub-headings?
