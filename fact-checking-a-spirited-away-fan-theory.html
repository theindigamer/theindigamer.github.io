<p><strong>Clar&shy;i&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion (2017/13/10):</strong> This post is in&shy;tend&shy;ed as a dis&shy;cus&shy;sion of
the <em>sub&shy;text</em> of the movie, not as cre&shy;ative in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion. By sub&shy;text,
I mean an in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion where all the points made are sup&shy;port&shy;ed by
ev&shy;i&shy;dence in the text/in the ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate his&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;cal con&shy;text of the text.</p>
<p>I have light&shy;ly edit&shy;ed the ar&shy;ti&shy;cle to avoid com&shy;ing across as over&shy;ly ar&shy;ro&shy;gant,
the rest is as is.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>To&shy;day morn&shy;ing, while brows&shy;ing my Face&shy;book feed, I bumped across an im&shy;age
shared via 9gag stat&shy;ing a fan the&shy;o&shy;ry re&shy;gard&shy;ing Stu&shy;dio Ghi&shy;b&shy;li’s <em>Spir&shy;it&shy;ed
Away</em> (2001). While the im&shy;age I saw is lo&shy;cat&shy;ed
<a href="https://9gag.com/gag/aRgKKq7">here</a>, I’ve copied the text be&shy;low –
in case the link dies any time soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve al&shy;ways won&shy;dered why the sym&shy;bol “ゆ” (said “yu”) was on the door
to the bath house. I asked my Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese teach&shy;er, and he wasn’t too
sure so I did a lit&shy;tle re&shy;search.</p>
<p>The sym&shy;bol used on the en&shy;trance to 温泉 (on&shy;sen) and 銭湯 (sen&shy;to
[sic]), or Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese bath hous&shy;es. The word “yu” is trans&shy;lat&shy;ed to “hot
wa&shy;ter”. So, makes sense to be a bath house, yes?</p>
<p>Then I did more read&shy;ing. Dur&shy;ing the Edo pe&shy;ri&shy;od, these pub&shy;lic baths
be&shy;came more pop&shy;u&shy;lar for men be&shy;cause of wom&shy;en who start&shy;ed work&shy;ing at
these com&shy;mu&shy;nal baths, wash&shy;ing men and sell&shy;ing sex. These bath hous&shy;es
were called “yu&shy;na baro”. The wom&shy;en were known as 湯女, or “yu&shy;na”.
This di&shy;rect&shy;ly trans&shy;lates to “hot wa&shy;ter wom&shy;an”. So ba&shy;si&shy;cal&shy;ly, they
were broth&shy;els. Guess what the wom&shy;an who ran this bath house would be
called?</p>
<p>ゆばば Yuba&shy;ba. (trans&shy;lates di&shy;rect&shy;ly to “hot wa&shy;ter old wom&shy;an”)</p>
<p>Yuba&shy;ba is the name of the wom&shy;an who runs the bath house in Spir&shy;it&shy;ed
Away. If you watch Spir&shy;it&shy;ed Away in Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese, the fe&shy;male work&shy;ers are
re&shy;ferred to as yu&shy;na.</p>
<p>Chi&shy;hi&shy;ro was forced to change her name to Sen. Kin&shy;da like how
strip&shy;pers get names like “Can&shy;dy”.</p>
<p>カオナシ/No-Face keeps of&shy;fer&shy;ing Chi&shy;hi&shy;ro mon&shy;ey. He “wants her”.</p>
<p>THEN I read in&shy;ter&shy;views with Miyaza&shy;ki. This was all put in
in&shy;ten&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly. As we all know. Miyaza&shy;ki’s sto&shy;ries are weaved with
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent themes and metaphors. He said he was tack&shy;ling the is&shy;sue of
the sex in&shy;dus&shy;try rapid&shy;ly grow&shy;ing in Japan, and the chil&shy;dren be&shy;ing
ex&shy;posed to it such ear&shy;ly ages is a prob&shy;lem.</p>
<p>This can be frus&shy;trat&shy;ing be&shy;cause so much gets lost in trans&shy;la&shy;tion,
and peo&shy;ple see it as this cute chil&shy;drens [sic] movie and this
“mas&shy;ter piece [sic] of an&shy;i&shy;ma&shy;tion” (which it de&shy;fi&shy;nate&shy;ly [sic] is)
in&shy;stead of the re&shy;al state&shy;ment that it is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lit&shy;tle search&shy;ing shows that the same text has been cir&shy;cu&shy;lat&shy;ing for a
while now (sur&shy;prise, sur&shy;prise) un&shy;der var&shy;i&shy;ous guis&shy;es.</p>
<p>At first sight, per&shy;haps one might think that the the&shy;o&shy;ry is be&shy;liev&shy;able,
as ev&shy;i&shy;denced by many peo&shy;ple shar&shy;ing and lik&shy;ing it on Face&shy;book (and oth&shy;er
sites in the past).</p>
<p><strong>Meta-claim</strong>: A cer&shy;tain read&shy;ing of a text should be tak&shy;en se&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly on&shy;ly if
there are one or more as&shy;pects of the text can be “bet&shy;ter” ex&shy;plained by that
read&shy;ing over any oth&shy;er read&shy;ing.</p>
<p>I am not go&shy;ing to jus&shy;ti&shy;fy this point here. If you do not agree, then you might
want to stop read&shy;ing here.</p>
<p><strong>Claim</strong>: The fan the&shy;o&shy;ry above does not</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>rep&shy;re&shy;sent au&shy;tho&shy;ri&shy;al in&shy;tent, con&shy;trary to the claim near the end.</li>
<li>is not con&shy;sis&shy;tent with the film un&shy;less se&shy;ri&shy;ous cre&shy;ative lib&shy;er&shy;ty is
tak&shy;en with in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Anal&shy;y&shy;sis</strong>:</p>
<p>For brevi&shy;ty, let us call the de&shy;fault hy&shy;poth&shy;e&shy;sis – where the bath house
rep&shy;re&shy;sents a mere bath house as op&shy;posed to a broth&shy;el – the “bath house
the&shy;o&shy;ry”.</p>
<p>Let’s try to break down the fan the&shy;o&shy;ry bit-by-bit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve al&shy;ways won&shy;dered why the sym&shy;bol “ゆ” (said “yu”) was on the door
to the bath house. I asked my Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese teach&shy;er, and he wasn’t too
sure so I did a lit&shy;tle re&shy;search.</p>
<p>The sym&shy;bol used on the en&shy;trance to 温泉 (on&shy;sen) and 銭湯 (sen&shy;to), or
Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese bath hous&shy;es. The word “yu” is trans&shy;lat&shy;ed to “hot wa&shy;ter”.
So, makes sense to be a bath house, yes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese-Eng&shy;lish dic&shy;tio&shy;nary states that 湯 (ゆ) is a com&shy;mon word
mean&shy;ing (1) hot wa&shy;ter, (2) hot bath; hot spring, (3) molten iron. 温泉
(on&shy;sen) usu&shy;al&shy;ly refers to a hot spring where&shy;as 銭湯 (sen&shy;tō) a pub&shy;lic
bath house where you pay for en&shy;trance. So far so good.</p>
<blockquote>
Then I did more read&shy;ing. Dur&shy;ing the Edo pe&shy;ri&shy;od,</blockquote>
<p>First of all let’s see what “Edo pe&shy;ri&shy;od” means. Loose&shy;ly speak&shy;ing,
Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese his&shy;to&shy;ry is di&shy;vid&shy;ed in&shy;to pe&shy;ri&shy;ods based on rulers; the Edo pe&shy;ri&shy;od
and the fol&shy;low&shy;ing pe&shy;ri&shy;ods are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Edo pe&shy;ri&shy;od - 1603 to 1868</li>
<li>Mei&shy;ji pe&shy;ri&shy;od - 1868 to 1912</li>
<li>Taishō pe&shy;ri&shy;od - 1912 to 1928</li>
<li>Shōwa pe&shy;ri&shy;od - 1926 to 1989</li>
<li>Hei&shy;sei pe&shy;ri&shy;od - 1989 to present</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see the Edo pe&shy;ri&shy;od is not “re&shy;cent his&shy;to&shy;ry” in that there have
been four pe&shy;ri&shy;ods af&shy;ter it. No&shy;tice that the rest of the fan the&shy;o&shy;ry does
not pro&shy;vide any ev&shy;i&shy;dence that the movie is ac&shy;tu&shy;al&shy;ly re&shy;fer&shy;ring to the Edo
pe&shy;ri&shy;od, which weak&shy;ens the claim.</p>
<p>If I were to write a post which men&shy;tioned “red ocean”, does it
au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly mean that I’m mak&shy;ing a Home&shy;r&shy;ic ref&shy;er&shy;ence even though
noth&shy;ing else in the post seems to sug&shy;gest so? Very like&shy;ly not.</p>
<blockquote>
these pub&shy;lic baths be&shy;came more pop&shy;u&shy;lar for men be&shy;cause of wom&shy;en who
start&shy;ed work&shy;ing at these com&shy;mu&shy;nal baths, wash&shy;ing men and sell&shy;ing
sex.</blockquote>
<p>This might be true – well, Wikipedia does men&shy;tion this on the sen&shy;tō
page with [Ci&shy;ta&shy;tion Need&shy;ed]. For now, let’s as&shy;sume that it’s true.</p>
<p>One might ob&shy;ject with the fol&shy;low&shy;ing: since mod&shy;ern Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese bath hous&shy;es
do not fea&shy;ture wom&shy;en help&shy;ing you bathe, the pres&shy;ence of wom&shy;en cer&shy;tain&shy;ly
in&shy;di&shy;cates that the movie is re&shy;fer&shy;ring to the Edo pe&shy;ri&shy;od.</p>
<p>Well, that isn’t 100% true though – there are mod&shy;ern bath hous&shy;es
of&shy;fer&shy;ing a va&shy;ri&shy;ety of ser&shy;vices
[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sent%C5%8D#Future">1</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>
Oth&shy;er bath hous&shy;es with less pris&shy;tine build&shy;ings or set&shy;tings change
in&shy;to so called su&shy;per sen&shy;tō and try to of&shy;fer a wider va&shy;ri&shy;ety of
ser&shy;vices be&shy;yond the stan&shy;dard two or three bath&shy;tubs. They may in&shy;clude
a va&shy;ri&shy;ety of saunas, rein&shy;tro&shy;duce steam baths, in&shy;clude jacuzzis, and
may even have a wa&shy;ter slide. They may al&shy;so of&shy;fer ser&shy;vices be&shy;yond
mere cleans&shy;ing, and turn in&shy;to a spa, of&shy;fer&shy;ing med&shy;i&shy;cal baths,
mas&shy;sages, mud baths, fit&shy;ness cen&shy;ters, etc.</blockquote>
<p>Let’s pro&shy;ceed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These bath hous&shy;es were called “yu&shy;na baro”. The wom&shy;en were known as
湯女, or “yu&shy;na”. This di&shy;rect&shy;ly trans&shy;lates to “hot wa&shy;ter wom&shy;an”. So
ba&shy;si&shy;cal&shy;ly, they were broth&shy;els. Guess what the wom&shy;an who ran this
bath house would be called?</p>
<p>ゆばば Yuba&shy;ba. (trans&shy;lates di&shy;rect&shy;ly to “hot wa&shy;ter old wom&shy;an”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “yu&shy;na baro” term sounds plau&shy;si&shy;ble. The clos&shy;est I’ve found is this
book [<a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=yunafuro">2</a>]
men&shy;tion&shy;ing the term “yu&shy;na&shy;furo”. The trans&shy;la&shy;tion for “yu&shy;na” is al&shy;so
cor&shy;rect. The broth&shy;el part is au&shy;to&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly im&shy;plied by the “sell&shy;ing sex”
in the pre&shy;vi&shy;ous line, so this doesn’t add much.</p>
<p>The “yuba&shy;ba” term al&shy;so sounds plau&shy;si&shy;ble; let’s as&shy;sume it’s his&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly
ac&shy;cu&shy;rate (for the sake of ar&shy;gu&shy;ment and avoid&shy;ing chas&shy;ing point&shy;less
ref&shy;er&shy;ences over ter&shy;mi&shy;nol&shy;o&shy;gy).</p>
<blockquote>
Yuba&shy;ba is the name of the wom&shy;an who runs the bath house in Spir&shy;it&shy;ed
Away. If you watch Spir&shy;it&shy;ed Away in Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese, the fe&shy;male work&shy;ers are
re&shy;ferred to as yu&shy;na.</blockquote>
<p>At first glance, this might seem that it lends sup&shy;port to the fan
the&shy;o&shy;ry. How&shy;ev&shy;er, it doesn’t – for the bath house the&shy;o&shy;ry, it is nat&shy;u&shy;ral
that the wom&shy;en work&shy;ing there be called yu&shy;na and the old wom&shy;an run&shy;ning it
be called Yuba&shy;ba (al&shy;though the lat&shy;ter per&shy;haps be&shy;trays a lack of
imag&shy;i&shy;na&shy;tion). Since both the&shy;o&shy;ries reach the same con&shy;clu&shy;sions for the
nam&shy;ing scheme, the names can&shy;not sup&shy;port any the&shy;o&shy;ry over the oth&shy;er.</p>
<p>More&shy;over, Yu&shy;na is a fair&shy;ly com&shy;mon ba&shy;by name in Japan
[<a href="http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/11/13/japans-top-baby-names-in-2015-will-naruto-influenced-monickers-still-reign-supreme/">3</a>] (fn. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1">1</a>).
Even though some Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese peo&shy;ple don’t know how to name their ba&shy;bies and
have names re&shy;ject&shy;ed by the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment
[<a href="http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/06/10/kanji-fail-japanese-parents-shocked-to-learn-their-baby-girls-name-has-inappropriate-meaning/">4</a>],
giv&shy;en the fact that Yu&shy;na is very com&shy;mon and ap&shy;proved by the gov&shy;ern&shy;ment, I
think that the in&shy;ter&shy;pre&shy;ta&shy;tion of “yu&shy;na” as a wom&shy;an in a broth&shy;el is
ob&shy;scure at best.</p>
<blockquote>
Chi&shy;hi&shy;ro was forced to change her name to Sen. Kin&shy;da like how
strip&shy;pers get names like “Can&shy;dy”.</blockquote>
<p>Again for the sake of ar&shy;gu&shy;ment, sup&shy;pose that Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese strip&shy;pers al&shy;so use
nick&shy;names like those po&shy;trayed in Amer&shy;i&shy;can me&shy;dia. Sec&shy;ond&shy;ly, Sen doesn’t
seem like a strip&shy;per’s name at all, un&shy;less for some rea&shy;son, all the
folks go&shy;ing to the bath house are math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cians. Why? From the movie’s
Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese ti&shy;tle, the ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate Kan&shy;ji is 千 (Sen) which means 1000.</p>
<p>A sim&shy;pler ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion for Chi&shy;hi&shy;ro’s al&shy;ter&shy;nate name (Sen: 千) is that it
is sim&shy;ply a con&shy;trac&shy;tion of her cur&shy;rent name (Chi&shy;hi&shy;ro: 千尋), in&shy;tend&shy;ed as
an in&shy;nocu&shy;ous nick&shy;name. Name con&shy;trac&shy;tion to form nick&shy;names is not
un&shy;com&shy;mon in Japan, where even Brad Pitt (ブラッドピット) is short&shy;ened to
Bu&shy;rapi (ブラピ). For chil&shy;dren, the con&shy;tract&shy;ed name is usu&shy;al&shy;ly suf&shy;fixed
with -chan, but not al&shy;ways. Wikipedia gives the fol&shy;low&shy;ing ex&shy;am&shy;ple
[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_name#Nicknames">5</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>
For ex&shy;am&shy;ple, a girl named Megu&shy;mi may be called Ke&shy;ichan or just Kei,
be&shy;cause the char&shy;ac&shy;ter used to write the Megu&shy;mi, 恵, can al&shy;so be read
Kei.</blockquote>
<p>As ear&shy;li&shy;er, this name change doesn’t lend sup&shy;port to the fan the&shy;o&shy;ry
be&shy;cause there’s a very sim&shy;ple and rea&shy;son&shy;able ex&shy;pla&shy;na&shy;tion for it
oth&shy;er&shy;wise.</p>
<p>On to the next point.</p>
<blockquote>
カオナシ/No-Face keeps of&shy;fer&shy;ing Chi&shy;hi&shy;ro mon&shy;ey. He “wants her”.</blockquote>
<p>Does tip&shy;ping ho&shy;tel staff = you want to get laid? No.
No-face is a cus&shy;tomer, of course, it is of&shy;fer&shy;ing mon&shy;ey for ser&shy;vice.
Again, this point does not lend ad&shy;di&shy;tion&shy;al sup&shy;port to the fan the&shy;o&shy;ry be&shy;cause
it works equal&shy;ly well with the bath house the&shy;o&shy;ry.</p>
<blockquote>
THEN I read in&shy;ter&shy;views with Miyaza&shy;ki. This was all put in
in&shy;ten&shy;tion&shy;al&shy;ly. As we all know. Miyaza&shy;ki’s sto&shy;ries are weaved with
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent themes and metaphors. He said he was tack&shy;ling the is&shy;sue of
the sex in&shy;dus&shy;try rapid&shy;ly grow&shy;ing in Japan, and the chil&shy;dren be&shy;ing
ex&shy;posed to it such ear&shy;ly ages is a prob&shy;lem.</blockquote>
<p>Of course, be&shy;ing a 9gag im&shy;age, it lacks ci&shy;ta&shy;tions. While I’m un&shy;able to
find the ac&shy;tu&shy;al in&shy;ter&shy;view where this point is men&shy;tioned, sev&shy;er&shy;al
dif&shy;fer&shy;ent sites point to this source
[<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/SpiritedAway">6</a>]:</p>
<blockquote>
Quote from Miyaza&shy;ki: “I think the most ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate way to sym&shy;bol&shy;ize
the mod&shy;ern world is the sex in&shy;dus&shy;try. Hasn’t Ja&shy;pa&shy;nese so&shy;ci&shy;ety be&shy;come
like the sex in&shy;dus&shy;try?”</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this leaves a key ques&shy;tion unan&shy;swered - why does this quote
ap&shy;ply to <em>Spir&shy;it&shy;ed Away</em> (as seems to be claimed by the fan the&shy;o&shy;ry)?</p>
<p>As op&shy;posed to the fan the&shy;o&shy;ry, there are sev&shy;er&shy;al sources which in&shy;di&shy;rect&shy;ly
sup&shy;port the bath house the&shy;o&shy;ry
[<a href="http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao-miyazaki/">7</a>]

pri&shy;mar&shy;i&shy;ly for chil&shy;dren. There are many oth&shy;er peo&shy;ple who are ca&shy;pa&shy;ble

moth&shy;er hap&shy;pened to eat some&shy;thing they shouldn’t have, and so be&shy;came
pigs. The movie ap&shy;pears to be satire, but that isn’t my pur&shy;pose. I
have five young fe&shy;male friends who are about the same age as
Hi&shy;ira&shy;gi-san*, and I spend ev&shy;ery sum&shy;mer with them at my moun&shy;tain
cab&shy;in. I want&shy;ed to make a movie they could en&shy;joy. That is why I
start&shy;ed this film, and that is my true pur&shy;pose.</p>
<p>*HI&shy;IRA&shy;GI Ru&shy;mi, the 13-year-old voice ac&shy;tress of Chi&shy;hi&shy;ro. She was at
the press con&shy;fer&shy;ence dur&shy;ing which this in&shy;ter&shy;view took place. [sic]</p>
<p>We have made “To&shy;toro,” which was for small chil&shy;dren, “La&shy;pu&shy;ta,” in
which a boy sets out on a jour&shy;ney, and “Ki&shy;ki’s De&shy;liv&shy;ery Ser&shy;vice,” in
which a teenag&shy;er has to live with her&shy;self. We have not made a film
for 10-year-old girls, who are in the first stage of their
ado&shy;les&shy;cence. So, I read the shou&shy;jo man&shy;ga such as Nakayoshi or Ri&shy;bon
which they left at my moun&shy;tain cab&shy;in.</p>
<p>I felt this coun&shy;try on&shy;ly of&shy;fered such things as crush&shy;es and ro&shy;mance
to 10-year-old girls, though, and look&shy;ing at my young friends, I
felt this was not what they held dear in their hearts, not what they
want&shy;ed. And so I won&shy;dered if I could make a movie in which they
could be hero&shy;ines…</p>
<p>If they find this movie to be ex&shy;cit&shy;ing, it will be a suc&shy;cess in my
mind. They can’t lie. Un&shy;til now, I made “I wish there was such a
per&shy;son” lead&shy;ing char&shy;ac&shy;ters. This time, how&shy;ev&shy;er, I cre&shy;at&shy;ed a hero&shy;ine
who is an or&shy;di&shy;nary girl, some&shy;one with whom the au&shy;di&shy;ence can
sym&shy;pa&shy;thize, some&shy;one about whom they can say, “Yes, it’s like that.”
It’s very im&shy;por&shy;tant to make it plain and un&shy;ex&shy;ag&shy;ger&shy;at&shy;ed. Start&shy;ing
with that, it’s not a sto&shy;ry in which the char&shy;ac&shy;ters grow up, but a
sto&shy;ry in which they draw on some&shy;thing al&shy;ready in&shy;side them, brought
out by the par&shy;tic&shy;u&shy;lar cir&shy;cum&shy;stances… I want&shy;ed to tell such a sto&shy;ry
in this movie. I want my young friends to live like that, and I
think they, too, have such a wish.</p>

<p>I think that these two in&shy;ter&shy;views sup&shy;port part 1 of the claim and the
re&shy;main&shy;ing ar&shy;gu&shy;ments sup&shy;port part 2.</p>

<dd>Yes, I re&shy;alise that the list is for 2015 where&shy;as the movie re&shy;leased
in 2001 but I don’t think that af&shy;fects the ar&shy;gu&shy;ment much and I was
un&shy;for&shy;tu&shy;nate&shy;ly un&shy;able to find old&shy;er sta&shy;tis&shy;tics for 2001. I al&shy;so
haven’t used the 2013 sta&shy;tis&shy;tics (linked in that ar&shy;ti&shy;cle) be&shy;cause it
has the name Yuina on top (which you can see is bunched to&shy;geth&shy;er with
Yu&shy;na in 2013) and I didn’t want to go in&shy;to this point in ex&shy;ces&shy;sive
de&shy;tail as it is on&shy;ly tan&shy;gen&shy;tial&shy;ly rel&shy;e&shy;vant.</dd>
