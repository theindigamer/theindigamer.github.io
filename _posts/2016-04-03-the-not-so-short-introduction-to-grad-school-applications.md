## Intended audience

This post is primarily aimed at undergraduate seniors who will be applying for admission to a PhD program in the US. While some graduate schools also offer M.S. degrees (either course-based or thesis-based), I do not have first-hand experience of applying for such a program. However, some basic tips for writing a statement of purpose, prepping for standardized tests, getting letters of recommendation etc. carry over with little to no modification for an M.S. application, especially for a thesis-based program.

Although I applied to PhD programs in physics, I have attempted to keep the advice general instead of being specific to physics applicants. These notes are basically a condensed version of all the stuff that I wish I'd known at the very beginning of the application period.

As with most things on the internet, take the following advice with a grain of salt. I have based it on the stuff I've read and done, but YMMV.

### Additional resources (if you're tired of my writing already)

* **[Acad.SE][acadse]** - There are already a large number of questions about graduate admissions that have been answered by academics. If you are familiar with StackOverflow or AskUbuntu, think of academia.stackexchange as a cousin in the same family. Don't forget to take the site tour first.
* **[/r/GradAdmissions][/r/gradadmissions]** - A more informal place to ask questions. The mix of applicants and academics is a bit different from Acad.SE. Overall, it also seems to have lesser participation. Check out the sidebar for important links.
* **Admissions offices** - If you feel that the information available on the university website is insufficient, or you find the wording unclear, contact the admissions office of the relevant department/college. I've mostly had positive experiences with replies but the response times can vary drastically from office to office, so send emails as soon as you can.
* **Your seniors** - For little bits and pieces of advice which are not available on the web, talking to seniors is invaluable. More importantly, if you have access to more than a few data points, the mapping between credentials and grad school can give you a good idea of where you should and shouldn't apply. While comparing credentials across universities is fairly difficult, you *can* roughly compare your own with those of your seniors at the time of application.
* **Your professors** - If you are particularly interested in some subfields, talk to professors in your department working in related areas. They can point you in the right direction for papers and research groups which will help you in the pre-application phase.
* **[The Grad Cafe][gradcafe]** - Fairly useful for knowing credentials of students admitted to different universities. Scouring the website will yield many additional data points compared to just talking to seniors. You can also talk to other applicants in the forums.

## So you want to go to grad school...

(M.S. applicants can skip over this section.)

Do you really want to? Do you really, really want to? Do your reasons lie amongst the following:

1. You can't find a job.
2. You dream of lots of money or fame or prestige.
3. You just want to help people/do good in the world.
4. It's the next logical step.
5. You want to understand yourself.
6. You have a burning research question.
7. You have a career goal that can be addressed only by a doctorate degree.

These reasons are listed from an article from the American Psychological Association's website titled "[Are you on the right path?][apareasons]". The first five are listed as bad reasons for wanting to go to grad school, whereas the last two are good reasons. I strongly suggest that you read the entire article.

## Stuff you'll need

* **A friend in deed** - You can provide help each other in multiple ways: proof-reading and giving feedback on SOPs, studying together for tests, scouting for universities etc.
* **Diligence** - The whole application process takes a lot of time and energy, especially scouting and getting your first SOP ready. It is better to spread your tasks over a few weeks/months and start submitting early instead of aiming to submit everything right before the deadline.
* **Common sense** - For example, regularly backup all your application documents; cloud syncing makes this especially easy. Keep a separate checklist of application documents for each university and keep it updated as you upload stuff. Don't forget to note all the deadlines in the same checklist. I have also sprinkled a bit of common sense advice throughout this article, just in case. 
* **A thorough understanding of ... yourself** - You need to understand what is important for you and what is not. Do you have any food restrictions? Is the location -- say city versus college town -- important for you? What standard of living would you be okay with? A large chunk of your time will be spent just in making decisions; figuring out your priorities beforehand is crucial to the process.

## Rough application timeline

Most universities have fall admissions. Some accept applicants for spring semesters as well; make sure that you check this for the graduate school you are applying to as different schools in the same university may have different schedules. Very few have rolling admissions. 

While most universities have deadlines around 15 December or 15 January, you should check with the university that you will be applying to. Finishing scouting early is crucial; otherwise you might miss out on some universities which have early deadlines around 1 December.

## Scouting a.k.a. how to go mad step 1

The process of scouting is extremely time-consuming. You have to arrive at a shortlist of 5~10 schools which you will actually applying to out of potential 50~100 universities. The limiting factors for applying to a larger number of universities are your time, sanity and money (not necessarily in that order). If you are applying to say 8 universities, then I would suggest the following break-down:

* 2/3 top schools - You feel that you have a low chance of being selected because your credentials seem weaker compared to past years' admits.
* 3 "middle" schools - You feel that you have a moderate chance of being selected because your credentials are roughly similar to past years' admits.
* 3/2 backup schools - You feel that you have a very good chance of being selected because your credentials are much better than those of past years' admits.

As mentioned earlier, understanding your priorities is key to deciding where to apply. Doing so before actually beginning scouting is better than figuring out things on the fly and then going back to re-evaluate universities using your new criteria.

While looking at particular research groups is important, you should also look at the department as a whole, lest your research interests change between getting admitted and actually starting research.

Apart from personal preferences, you should consider the following factors:

* Match of research interests (PI) - You *must* read papers here. The introductory information given on professors' webpages should only be used as a pre-filter.
* Past PhD students (PI) - Did they attend conferences and publish regularly during the PhD? Were all papers published jointly with the advisor? Where are they working now?
* Research facilities (dept.) - Do the groups have easy access to good computing or experimental facilities?
* Funding: Do most graduate students receive TAs/RAs initially? Once you've started working on your thesis project, do you still need to TA?
* Where PhD students finally end up (dept., not debt) - Compare this with your own career goals.
* Typical PhD completion time (dept.) - A completion time around 5~6 years is typical (in physics).
* Coursework (dept.) - Are there a lot of compulsory courses? Are there a variety of electives?
* Selectivity (dept.) - What is the admit rate for applicants? In physics, ~8% would be highly selective.
* Work atmosphere (dept./PI) - If you can contact a current grad student, ask about intangibles such as sense of community, friendliness etc.

At the end of the scouting process, you should have a priority [tree][wiki-tree] (ideally a list) at hand.

## Standardized tests (and standard subheadings)

Most US universities require TOEFL and GRE scores, both of which are conducted by [ETS][ets]. Make sure that you have shortlisted at least 4 universities before registering for the GRE, as you can send scores to them for "free." AFAIK, these tests are available only in an online format (in India) so make sure your typing speed is up to snuff as you'll be required to write short essays during the tests.

Depending on your field, you might also have to give a GRE subject test. There are also 4 "free" score reports for the GRE Subject test. All in all, you have to give at most 3 tests, assuming you do well on your first attempt.

**Disclaimer**: This information is based on my experience for the GRE Physics Subject test and may not accurately reflect on the preparation required for other Subject tests. Also, I was fairly well-prepared for the GRE General test before actually starting formal preparations (I obtained ~320/340 on my first practice test with zero prep).

**Before you start prep!** Write 1 practice paper for each test at the very beginning. Now you know where your weaknesses lie and you can start preparing in a focused (or focussed :P) manner instead of just blindly following somebody's advice.

### GRE General test

#### Verbal reasoning

You are expected to understand the language at multiple levels of granularity: word (meaning, function...), phrase (change of flow...), sentence (strengthening an argument, summarizing...), paragraph (evidence, counter-argument...) and article (intent...). Read ETS's website for more details.

The best way to prepare for this section is practice (duh!). I recommend using ETS's official book for practice, after you've looked at the examples on their website, as the material is fairly close in spirit to the actual test. Your priority should be to do official material first.

For word lists, take any app of your choice which has various levels of difficulty (I used the free version of Magoosh). Practice regularly. You might find new words difficult to memorize in some cases. I strongly suggest using [Anki][anki] for these words. Anki is a spaced repetition software ([SRS][srs]), which allows you to create and *intelligently* schedule [flashcards][flashcard], which can be synced across multiple devices. Possible flashcard template: question = word, and answer = (meaning, example sentence). The Anki documentation is fairly well written and there is a nice, (currently) free ebook called [Anki Essentials][ankiessentials] by Alex Vermeer if you don't like reading documentation.

#### Analytical Writing

This section has two parts (i) writing a small essay from a short prompt and (ii) dissection/analysis of a given piece. The ETS website has several writing examples -- with scoring and the rationale behind it -- as well as a big pool of topics.

As earlier, the best way to prepare is practice; here, the aforementioned "diligent friend" should come in handy to correct your responses :P. Make sure that you get sufficient typing practice. For topics, I suggest using ETS's pool as a primary source.

One possible approach for the writing tasks is to brainstorm on a piece of paper for ~3-5 minutes before starting the essay. During this time, you can decide on the basic structure of your response, make sure that the arguments flow logically, identify the points to be emphasized etc. While general writing tips and strategies apply here, IMO, it is advisable to model your responses in the style of those officially marked 5/6 or 6/6 by ETS. 

Avoid using keyboard shortcuts for copy+paste to reorder your response during practice. In my experience, these didn't work with ETS's testing software (which is similar to that on their website), but there are on-screen buttons for the same, which are somewhat inconvenient. Hitting Ctrl-Z (undo) also does not work if you make some mistake here. I can't recall if there is a button for it in the software.

#### Quantitative Aptitude

The syllabus for this section very roughly corresponds to math from Grade 10 and below. If you have a STEM background, you shouldn't have any problems with this section, perhaps barring the statistics portion (where the exact definitions with â‰¤ instead of < are important). IMO, the material available freely on ETS's website and elsewhere should be sufficient for this.

#### Practice tests

Complete practice tests at regular intervals to assess your progress. I suggest completing 5-6 tests overall (more if you aren't hitting your targets). Try your best to simulate the actual testing environment during practice, by timing each section appropriately. Do not skip over re-checking your answers twice or thrice if you finish a section ahead of time -- even if you are terribly bored or lazy -- for obvious reasons. For the writing section in particular, I suggest selecting a random topic from ETS's pool instead of the one in the question paper.

After testing is over, take a short break and complete grading. For maximum efficiency, it is important to analyse your mistakes and use them for targeted study.

Here, in contrast to the individual sections, I suggest saving the official ETS material -- they have free software on their site and a practice book as well -- for the last, when your preparation is 100% complete. In principle, these tests should give you the best estimate for your score on test day.

### TOEFL

The TOEFL should be a piece of cake if you've prepared well for the GRE. Two additional sections on the TOEFL which do not have equivalents on the GRE are the Listening and Speaking sections.

For the Listening section, note down the important points mentioned in the conversation. Draw pictures instead of writing everything, if possible. The details in your head (you won't be able to write everything down) plus those on your paper should roughly form a complete representation of what you heard. Also, listen carefully, as the audio will not be repeated.

IIRC, the Speaking section also gives information using audio, so the Listening section tips also apply here. It is okay to take a short pause to organize your thoughts before answering the question. Also, speak clearly. Corollary: don't suffer from verbal diarrhea.

Take a couple of practice tests for the TOEFL if you aren't bored already. Avoid silly mistakes (hah!).

### GRE Subject test

You can see the exact syllabus [here][grephysics] on ETS's website. You *should* know almost all of it if you studied well for your undergraduate courses.

After completing a practice test, focus your preparations on your weaknesses. Pay attention to little details during testing and solve the questions again after completing all of them the first time, if you have some time left. If you prepare well and stay focused during the test, you can easily score 990/990.

### Test day tips

Take particular care of your health in the week before the test, particularly your voice for the TOEFL's speaking section. Decide how you will get to the test center on the day before test day so you have one less thing to worry about.

On test day, relax. Don't fret too much. Visit the toilet before the test and during breaks. Bring some food and water to the test centre. Bring your passport. Don't forget your passport at the test centre.

### Score reports and $$$

You must order additional official score reports for all applications apart from the 4 "free" ones. These cost about 27 USD for the GRE General + Subject test and 18 USD for the TOEFL *per score report*. The tests themselves cost around 150~200 USD each. This means that your net cost per application, including the cost of the application itself (duh!), will be about 150~175 USD.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't forget to select both the GRE General test and the GRE Subject test while buying additional reports! Otherwise you'll end up paying twice the money for the same service, once for the General test and once for the Subject test.

## Multiple dispatch

The time has finally come where you have to actually start filling your applications and sending them. The most common documents needed are:

* Online application - This should be fairly straight-forward to fill. Some universities might require you to give references for textbooks used in your undergraduate courses. It is important to contact the admissions office if you need any clarifications for filling the various sections.
* Statement of purpose - See below.
* Letters of recommendation (2+) - See below.
* Previous research experience (optional) - Upload and write about your publications here. 
* Personal Statement/Diversity statement (infrequent) - I don't understand this very well. You will be given instructions on what is expected. Also, check the additional resources.

### Please tell them how awesome I am

Most universities require three letters of recommendation, preferably from professors who are in a better position to judge your research capability. There are many good questions and answers on Acad.SE on recommendation letters:

[How do I effectively solicit a strong letter of recommendation from a professor?][lor-solicit]

[From whom do prospective grad students get recommendation letters?][lor-whom]

Comment on an [answer][lor-waive] to *Should I waive my right to view my recommendation letters?* -

> If someone doesn't feel comfortable writing a 100% positive letter about you, they **SHOULD** let you know when you ask; unfortunately, they don't always. Professors are human, too; some of us have trouble saying no. To be safe, it's best to swallow your ego and ask directly: "Are you willing to write me a strong recommendation letter? Do you have any concerns?"

### Let me tell you how awesome I am

Again, there are many good posts on Acad.SE with tips on writing SOPs. Here are a few important links:

[Choosing research ideas to include in a statement of purpose][sop-ideas]

[How many research interests should be included in a statement of purpose/objective][sop-howmany]

[What is a good length for the statement of purpose in a U.S. PhD application?][sop-length]

[What tone to use when talking about oneself in statement of purpose?][sop-tone]

[How to show that the department fits my research goal?][sop-fit]

[Writing the Statement of Purpose][sop-berkeley] by the Berkeley Graduate Division.

Try to obtain SOPs from successful candidates to get a better idea of what an SOP should look like.

*Hint:* You aren't actually supposed to tell them how awesome you think you are.

## A series of hopefully fortunate events

Undoubtedly, the most nerve-wracking part of the whole application process is waiting for admission decisions. Depending on your temperament, you might find yourself stuck in "waiting mode." Symptoms include but are not restricted to checking your email with an unhealthy frequency, finding your attention drifting away repeatedly, day-dreaming during lectures, always feeling sleepy and consistently falling short of time for the smallest tasks.

If you submitted your applications well before the deadlines, chances are that you might get a positive reply early; this will help you focus on the tasks at hand rather than being stuck in waiting mode. However, if you do find yourself stuck, then best of luck and may the Force be with you.

Also, I suggest reading "Surviving Your Stupid, Stupid Decision to Go to Grad School" by Adam Ruben in the meantime. You can have a chuckle or two and a bunch of "what if" questions that might put you in a small existential crisis (good preparation!). If that is not enough, I strongly recommend [PhD Comics][phdcomics].

Finally, as you get a positive reply from somewhere (you didn't skip over the backup schools part, did you?), you can jump with joy (relief?) for a few moments and tell your family, friends and Facebook friends and switch back to waiting mode for better decisions ;-). 

### (Edge case) Interview shenanigans

Some universities have an interview as a final part of the admission process. 

* Visit: The interview will be held at the university and will also act as an open house session where you can talk to grad students and different PIs. See the open house visits tips below for more details. Also check out [Acad.SE][acadse-interview].
* Video conference: If you are unable to visit, you can ask for an interview to be arranged via video conferencing/telephone. Check that the mic, speakers/headphones, and software are all working properly an hour before the interview so that you have some time to switch to Plan B if needed.

## (Optional) Post-decisions indecision

Assuming that you receive more than one positive response AND have a sufficiently complex priority tree (unlike ordinary people with their silly lines, pfft), you now have to decide between the admission offers based on some subset of the following factors:

* **Priority tree** - If correctly made, this *should* account for all your *a priori* knowledge.
* **Funding** - The only troublesome choice here is "no funding + good program" vs. "funding + not so good program." Again, there is no single correct answer; you have to take a call here based on your priorities. Try contacting students from both programs to get a rounded perspective.
* **Open house visits** - Although I can't speak from personal experience here, I've had a couple of friends who felt that such a visit was very helpful in making a decision. If you can go without any issues, I'd strongly suggest that you do; this is a good chance to talk to current grad students in an informal setting about work-life balance etc. This kind of information is relatively difficult to judge from posts online. If you can't go, email the PI(s) you are interested in working with to get a better idea of their research, how you might fit in his/her group etc.
* **Decisions of friends/SO** - This will not be applicable if you can make friends easily and don't have a SO. Otherwise, everything else being roughly equal, you should definitely consider going together rather than alone. Consider the fact that you will be in grad school for a long time (5+ years!) and you WILL face ups and downs. Having someone you trust by your side in the latter situation can make all the difference.

## You're not done yet!

If you don't already know, healthcare in the US is terribly expensive compared to most countries. If you are from developing country like India, almost everything will be more expensive in the US :P. Consider getting (doing) the following things (tasks) before leaving to save some money:

* Textbooks - These are usually atrociously expensive in the US, especially compared to Indian prices.
* Mandatory vaccines - Check with your university's international office for specifics.
* Health/dental checkups - With treatment as necessary.
* A driver's license - Check whether the state laws require an Internation Driving Permit (IDP).
* Pictures with family and friends - You won't be meeting them for the next 6-12 months.
* Home-cooked food - Not applicable if you're the one who cooks food at home.

## Fin

Right now (April 2016), I'm still waiting for more admission decisions to come in. I'll update the previous section and the application timeline at a later date.

Thanks for reading. If you want to give feedback, check the [FAQ](/faq).
