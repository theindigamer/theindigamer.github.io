Today morning, while browsing my Facebook feed, I bumped across an image shared via 9gag stating a fan theory regarding Studio Ghibli's _Spirited Away_ (2001). While the image I saw is located [here](https://9gag.com/gag/aRgKKq7), I've copied the text below -- in case the link dies any time soon.

> I've always wondered why the symbol "ゆ" (said "yu") was on the door to the bath house. I asked my Japanese teacher, and he wasn't too sure so I did a little research.

Guess what the woman who ran this bath house would be called?

A little searching shows that the same text has been circulating for a while now (surprise, surprise) under various guises.

At first sight, perhaps one might think that the theory is believable, as evidenced by many people sharing and liking it on Facebook (and other sites in the past).

**Proposition**: The fan theory above does not

1. represent authorial intent, contrary to the claim near the end.
2. is not consistent with the film unless serious creative liberty is taken with interpretation. More simply put, it is bollocks.

**Proof**:

For brevity, let us call the default hypothesis -- where the bath house represents a mere bath house as opposed to a brothel -- the "bath house theory".

Let's try to break down the fan theory bit-by-bit.

> I've always wondered why the symbol "ゆ" (said "yu") was on the door to the bath house. I asked my Japanese teacher, and he wasn't too sure so I did a little research.
>
> The symbol used on the entrance to 温泉 (onsen) and 銭湯 (sento), or Japanese bath houses. The word "yu" is translated to "hot water". So, makes sense to be a bath house, yes?

My Japanese-English dictionary states that 湯 (ゆ) is a common word meaning (1) hot water, (2) hot bath; hot spring, (3) molten iron. 温泉 (onsen) usually refers to a hot spring whereas 銭湯 (sentō) a public bath house where you pay for entrance. So far so good.

> Then I did more reading. During the Edo period,

First of all let's see what "Edo period" means. Loosely speaking, Japanese history is divided into periods based on rulers; the Edo period and the following periods are:

* Edo period - 1603 to 1868
* Meiji period - 1868 to 1912
* Taishō period - 1912 to 1928
* Shōwa period - 1926 to 1989
* Heisei period - 1989 to present

As you can see the Edo period is not "recent history" in that there have been four periods after it. Notice that the rest of the fan theory does not provide any evidence that the movie is actually referring to the Edo period, which weakens the claim.

If I were to write a post which mentioned "red ocean", does it automatically mean that I'm making a Homeric reference even though nothing else in the post seems to suggest so? Very likely not.

> these public baths became more popular for men because of women who started working at these communal baths, washing men and selling sex.

This might be true -- well, Wikipedia does mention this on the sentō page with [Citation Needed]. For now, let's assume that it's true.

One might object with the following: since modern Japanese bath houses do not feature women helping you bathe, the presence of women certainly indicates that the movie is referring to the Edo period.

Well, that isn't 100% true though -- there are modern bath houses offering a variety of services [[1][1]]:

> Other bath houses with less pristine buildings or settings change into so called super sentō and try to offer a wider variety of services beyond the standard two or three bathtubs. They may include a variety of saunas, reintroduce steam baths, include jacuzzis, and may even have a water slide. They may also offer services beyond mere cleansing, and turn into a spa, offering medical baths, massages, mud baths, fitness centers, etc.

Let's proceed.

> These bath houses were called "yuna baro". The women were known as 湯女, or "yuna". This directly translates to "hot water woman". So basically, they were brothels. Guess what the woman who ran this bath house would be called?
>
> ゆばば
> Yubaba. (translates directly to "hot water old woman")

The "yuna baro" term sounds plausible. The closest I've found is this book [[2][2]] mentioning the term "yunafuro". The translation for "yuna" is also correct. The brothel part is automatically implied by the "selling sex" in the previous line, so this doesn't add much.

The "yubaba" term also sounds plausible; let's assume it's historically accurate (for the sake of argument and avoiding chasing pointless references over terminology).

> Yubaba is the name of the woman who runs the bath house in Spirited Away. If you watch Spirited Away in Japanese, the female workers are referred to as yuna.

At first glance, this might seem that it lends support to the fan theory. However, it doesn't -- for the bath house theory, it is natural that the women working there be called yuna and the old woman running it be called Yubaba (although the latter perhaps betrays a lack of imagination). Since both theories reach the same conclusions for the naming scheme, the names cannot support any theory over the other.

Moreover, the Yuna is a fairly common baby name in Japan [[3][3]].[^1] Even though some Japanese people don't know how to name their babies and have names rejected by the government [[4][4]], the fact that Yuna is very common and approved by the government, I think that the interpretation of "yuna" as a woman in a brothel is obscure at best.

> Chihiro was forced to change her name to Sen. Kinda like how strippers get names like "Candy".

Again for the sake of argument, suppose that Japanese strippers also use nicknames like those potrayed in American media. Secondly, Sen doesn't seem like a stripper's name at all, unless for some reason, all the folks going to the bath house are mathematicians. Why? From the movie's Japanese title, the appropriate Kanji is 千 (Sen) which means 1000.

A simpler explanation for Chihiro's alternate name (Sen: 千) is that it is simply a contraction of her current name (Chihiro: 千尋), intended as an innocuous nickname.
Name contraction to form nicknames is not uncommon in Japan, where even Brad Pitt (ブラッドピット) is shortened to Burapi (ブラピ). For children, the contracted name is usually suffixed with -chan, but not always. Wikipedia gives the following example [[5][5]]:

> For example, a girl named Megumi may be called Keichan or just Kei, because the character used to write the Megumi, 恵, can also be read Kei.

As earlier, this name change doesn't lend support to the fan theory because there's a very simple and reasonable explanation for it otherwise.

On to the next point.

> カオナシ/No-Face keeps offering Chihiro money. He "wants her".

Well, this one's silly. Does tipping hotel staff = you want to get laid? No. No-face is a customer, of course, it is offering money for service. Again this point does not lend additional support to the fan theory.

> THEN I read interviews with Miyazaki. This was all put in intentionally. As we all know. Miyazaki's stories are weaved with different themes and metaphors. He said he was tackling the issue of the sex industry rapidly growing in Japan, and the children being exposed to it such early ages is a problem.

Of course, being a 9gag image, it lacks citations. While I'm unable to find the actual interview where this point is mentioned, several different sites point to this source [[6][6]]:

> Quote from Miyazaki: "I think the most appropriate way to symbolize the modern world is the sex industry. Hasn't Japanese society become like the sex industry?"

Of course, this leaves a key question unanswered -
why does this quote apply to _Spirited Away_ (as seems to be claimed by the fan theory)?

As opposed to the fan theory, there are several sources which indirectly support the bath house theory [[7][7]] [[8][8]]; I recommend reading both.

From [[7][7]], (published in Jan 2002, thus after _Spirited Away_):

> So you feel that the films you make are all aimed at children?
>
> I never said that Porco Rosso is a film for children, I don't think it is. But apart from Porco Rosso, all my films have been made primarily for children. There are many other people who are capable of making films for adults, so I'll leave that up to them and concentrate on the children.

From [[8][8]], titled "Interview: Miyazaki on Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi":

> Miyazaki: This movie is a story about a 10-year-old whose father and mother happened to eat something they shouldn't have, and so became pigs. The movie appears to be satire, but that isn't my purpose. I have five young female friends who are about the same age as Hiiragi-san*, and I spend every summer with them at my mountain cabin. I wanted to make a movie they could enjoy. That is why I started this film, and that is my true purpose.
>
>    *HIIRAGI Rumi, the 13-year-old voice actress of Chihiro. She was at the press conference during which this interview took place. [sic]
>
> We have made "Totoro," which was for small children, "Laputa," in which a boy sets out on a journey, and "Kiki's Delivery Service," in which a teenager has to live with herself. We have not made a film for 10-year-old girls, who are in the first stage of their adolescence. So, I read the shoujo manga such as Nakayoshi or Ribon which they left at my mountain cabin.
>
> I felt this country only offered such things as crushes and romance to 10-year-old girls, though, and looking at my young friends, I felt this was not what they held dear in their hearts, not what they wanted. And so I wondered if I could make a movie in which they could be heroines...
>
> If they find this movie to be exciting, it will be a success in my mind. They can't lie. Until now, I made "I wish there was such a person" leading characters. This time, however, I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize, someone about whom they can say, "Yes, it's like that." It's very important to make it plain and unexaggerated. Starting with that, it's not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them, brought out by the particular circumstances... I wanted to tell such a story in this movie. I want my young friends to live like that, and I think they, too, have such a wish.

I think that these two interviews prove part 1 of the proposition and the remaining arguments prove part 2. Q.E.D.

[^1]: Yes, I realise that the list is for 2015 whereas the movie released in 2001 but I don't think that affects the argument much and I was unfortunately unable to find older statistics for 2001. I also haven't used the 2013 statistics (linked in that article) because it has the name Yuina on top (which you can see is bunched together with Yuna in 2013) and I didn't want to go into this point in excessive detail as it is only tangentially relevant.
