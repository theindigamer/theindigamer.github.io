**Why have I migrated?**

There are many reasons. In no particular order,

* I've recently noticed that I have very little tolerance for slowly loading webpages. Using a statically generated site with zero Javascript means that my blog will load fast.
* With Wordpress, I had to choose between simpler, faster drafting (using my favourite text editor) and formatting (available in the Wordpress editor; I wasn't going to write HTML code). With Github pages and markdown, I can have the best of both worlds.
* I can use `git`. At this point, I'm just looking for excuses to use `git` so that I can learn more :P.
* As of today, I haven't published anything on the old blog for about 10 months. I'd rather start anew.
* The old blog was primarily focused on video games and a bit of tech (at an earlier stage). Now, I'd also like to put in a few articles about physics, programming, grad school etc.
* Github Pages has zero ads by default.

**Why aren't the posts from the old Wordpress blog available here?**

While I'm happy with the reviews, many of the articles are just dull or cringe-worthy in hindsight. I was initially going to have them here but finally decided against it.
