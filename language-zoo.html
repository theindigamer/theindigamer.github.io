<p>Once up&shy;on a time, the biobots sim&shy;ply had stones and wood.
They would com&shy;mu&shy;ni&shy;cate most&shy;ly by speech
– in a va&shy;ri&shy;ety of lan&shy;guages, if I may add, al&shy;though we’re not re&shy;al&shy;ly in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ed
in these here –
and pass&shy;ing along these ob&shy;jects with marks on them.
Of course, as you might well know, they weren’t sat&shy;is&shy;fied with these odd baubles
and trin&shy;kets
– if they were, this would be the end and not the be&shy;gin&shy;ning of the sto&shy;ry.
So they start&shy;ed mak&shy;ing wid&shy;gets, and soon enough,
the biobots were in&shy;fin&shy;ite&shy;ly charmed,
and thought these new&shy;fan&shy;gled thinga&shy;ma&shy;jigs to be ir&shy;re&shy;place&shy;able.</p>
<p>These wid&shy;gets were fast but not bright.
By “not bright” I mean not in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gent, not lack&shy;ing lu&shy;mi&shy;nos&shy;i&shy;ty.
While this is not a tale of ro&shy;mance,
do per&shy;mit me to use a cliché from the genre here and claim that
the cause of this ex&shy;u&shy;ber&shy;ant af&shy;fec&shy;tion was
the op&shy;pos&shy;ing na&shy;ture of the users and the used.</p>
<p>Since the wid&shy;gets were fast but not bright, the lan&shy;guages used by the biobots,
full of im&shy;plic&shy;it as&shy;sump&shy;tions and high&shy;ly sen&shy;si&shy;tive to con&shy;text,
were quite un&shy;suit&shy;able for is&shy;su&shy;ing tasks to the wid&shy;gets.
So they made new lan&shy;guages, by thought&shy;ful de&shy;sign,
not by ran&shy;dom al&shy;ter&shy;ations to ex&shy;ist&shy;ing ones.
A dis&shy;tin&shy;guish&shy;ing fea&shy;ture of these new lan&shy;guages was that
they had rel&shy;a&shy;tive&shy;ly rigid syn&shy;tax.
Con&shy;se&shy;quent&shy;ly, it didn’t mat&shy;ter if a biobot had speech (writ&shy;ing) im&shy;ped&shy;i&shy;ments
(or was a non-na&shy;tive speak&shy;er [or from an&shy;oth&shy;er city {sub&shy;urb}]);
the need for cor&shy;rect pro&shy;nun&shy;ci&shy;a&shy;tion and spell&shy;ing, apart from a hand&shy;ful
of mag&shy;ic words, had been ob&shy;vi&shy;at&shy;ed.</p>
<p>You must be think&shy;ing, “This must’ve split the so&shy;ci&shy;ety in&shy;to haves and have-nots,
no? Af&shy;ter all, not ev&shy;ery&shy;one must’ve liked the new lan&shy;guages, school&shy;ing, wid&shy;gets
et cetera.”, and you would be ab&shy;so&shy;lute&shy;ly right.
Since there was a sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cant de&shy;par&shy;ture from the ar&shy;bi&shy;trari&shy;ness/flex&shy;i&shy;bil&shy;i&shy;ty of
the so-called “nat&shy;u&shy;ral” lan&shy;guages
– the two be&shy;ing op&shy;po&shy;site sides of the same coin –
there were a large num&shy;ber of have-nots.
This isn’t a tale about com&shy;mu&shy;nism,
so it suf&shy;fices to say that there were many oth&shy;er rea&shy;sons why there were haves
and have-nots.
How&shy;ev&shy;er, in due time, the por&shy;tion of have-nots re&shy;duced.
So we shall fo&shy;cus on the sto&shy;ry of the haves here.</p>
<p>When the new lan&shy;guages were be&shy;ing cre&shy;at&shy;ed, a wise biobot sug&shy;gest&shy;ed that all of
them ought to be equal in some pre&shy;cise sense of the word equal.
While that biobot died for quite un&shy;re&shy;lat&shy;ed but none&shy;the&shy;less trag&shy;ic rea&shy;sons,
this sug&shy;ges&shy;tion was hearti&shy;ly tak&shy;en up by the rest and they sought to make most,
if not all, new lan&shy;guages equal in this sense.</p>
<p>In a short span of time, there emerged a zoo of lan&shy;guages,
some wilder than oth&shy;ers.
The wild lan&shy;guages of&shy;ten in&shy;duced a cer&shy;tain un&shy;in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gi&shy;ble mad&shy;ness (mad&shy;ness&shy;es?)
in the wid&shy;gets if some thought&shy;less ut&shy;ter&shy;ance was made by the us&shy;er.
The more civ&shy;il lan&shy;guages came with ma&shy;trons,
whose sole task was to en&shy;force or&shy;der&shy;li&shy;ness,
in an ef&shy;fort to pre&shy;vent the afore&shy;men&shy;tioned thought&shy;less&shy;ness from run&shy;ning ram&shy;pant.</p>
<p>While the biobots’ writ&shy;ings at the time don’t seem to in&shy;di&shy;cate that
they were aware of this, it is quite clear to us schol&shy;ars to&shy;day that
these ma&shy;trons were made in the im&shy;age of the biobots them&shy;selves,
and that their re&shy;la&shy;tion to the syn&shy;thet&shy;ic lan&shy;guage texts
– which I hence&shy;forth will re&shy;fer to as pro&shy;grams,
for brevi&shy;ty and his&shy;tor&shy;i&shy;cal ac&shy;cu&shy;ra&shy;cy –
and their au&shy;thors was not un&shy;like that of the biobots to&shy;wards the biotots.
Let me elab&shy;o&shy;rate.</p>
<p>Some biobots were care&shy;free and did not mind if their biotots in&shy;gest&shy;ed some earth
or ad&shy;he&shy;sives. Some were more vig&shy;i&shy;lant; they would ad&shy;mon&shy;ish the younglings if
any&shy;thing “wrong” hap&shy;pened, al&shy;though oft with&shy;out ra&shy;tio&shy;nale.
Then there were oth&shy;ers, who would take the ef&shy;fort to sug&shy;gest cor&shy;rec&shy;tive mea&shy;sures.
And of course, there were the ones with ex&shy;pec&shy;ta&shy;tions of per&shy;fec&shy;tion and on&shy;ly
per&shy;fec&shy;tion.</p>
<p>You can imag&shy;ine what the cor&shy;re&shy;spond&shy;ing ma&shy;trons would look like.
Some would hold your hand, speak&shy;ing metaphor&shy;i&shy;cal&shy;ly of course, al&shy;though there
were most cer&shy;tain&shy;ly wid&shy;gets which would do that, and a lot more,
if you in&shy;fer what I mean, but get&shy;ting back to the point,
some would hold you hand where&shy;as some would push you down a cliff with a
glee&shy;ful smile.
Tan&shy;gen&shy;tial&shy;ly, it is in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing to note an apho&shy;rism pop&shy;u&shy;lar at the time:
do not as&shy;sume mal&shy;ice that which can be ex&shy;plained by ig&shy;no&shy;rance.</p>
<p>If you per&shy;mit me to wax lyri&shy;cal for a bit:
from nim&shy;ble to glacial, from high&shy;ly dumb to high&shy;ly math&shy;e&shy;mat&shy;i&shy;cal,
from help&shy;ful to dead&shy;ly, from hubris&shy;tic to hum&shy;ble
and from worth&shy;less to all-pow&shy;er&shy;ful, there was the en&shy;tire spec&shy;trum.
As is clear, this pe&shy;ri&shy;od had quite the di&shy;ver&shy;si&shy;ty in lan&shy;guages.</p>
<p>While the have-nots con&shy;demned the haves for ex&shy;ces&shy;sive in&shy;dul&shy;gence,
be&shy;wil&shy;dered by the ex&shy;is&shy;tence of so many flavours of equal,
the haves spent nights and weeks and months and years and decades de&shy;bat&shy;ing
the same old de&shy;bates, need&shy;less&shy;ly and cease&shy;less&shy;ly rein&shy;vent&shy;ing the past.
“To what end?”, you might ask. And again, you’d be right. To what end?
As far as we can tell, a lot of pro&shy;grams, re&shy;gard&shy;less of lan&shy;guage,
were be&shy;ing writ&shy;ten sim&shy;ply to sell soap and the like,
and to re&shy;di&shy;rect biobots to buy&shy;ing soap and the like.</p>
<p>You might be feel&shy;ing a lit&shy;tle bit vi&shy;o&shy;lat&shy;ed now, “Soap and the like?
Sure&shy;ly you’re jok&shy;ing, mis&shy;ter!” and you’d be right in feel&shy;ing so.
Alas! His&shy;to&shy;ry doesn’t know, and hence fol&shy;low, the wis&shy;dom of the fu&shy;ture.
A lot of bright biobots
– again, I am talk&shy;ing about in&shy;tel&shy;li&shy;gence here, not lu&shy;mi&shy;nos&shy;i&shy;ty –
spent their en&shy;tire lives writ&shy;ing pro&shy;grams that sold or di&shy;rect&shy;ed biobots
to oth&shy;er pro&shy;grams that sold soap and the like.
About the ter&shy;ri&shy;ble taste&shy;less&shy;ness of this busi&shy;ness,
I would like to speak no more.</p>
<p>What I <em>would</em> like to speak about is how the sta&shy;tus quo changed.
It is an in&shy;ter&shy;est&shy;ing lit&shy;tle sub&shy;sto&shy;ry, bet&shy;ter dis&shy;cussed here rather in the
foot&shy;notes. Over a pe&shy;ri&shy;od of sev&shy;er&shy;al decades, there were mul&shy;ti&shy;ple in&shy;stances
where ma&shy;jor fi&shy;nan&shy;cial in&shy;sti&shy;tu&shy;tions were conned out of ridicu&shy;lous sums of
cur&shy;ren&shy;cy. Yes, I’m talk&shy;ing about the con&shy;cur&shy;ren&shy;cy cri&shy;sis.
In this time of his&shy;to&shy;ry, more than any oth&shy;er time since or pri&shy;or,
there were large mi&shy;gra&shy;tions of the haves from the old lan&shy;guages to what were
the prim&shy;i&shy;tive ver&shy;sions of the log&shy;i&shy;cal lan&shy;guages we all know and ad&shy;mire to&shy;day.</p>
<p>Af&shy;ter the con&shy;cur&shy;ren&shy;cy cri&shy;sis,
a lot of the haves re&shy;al&shy;ized the sig&shy;nif&shy;i&shy;cance of be&shy;friend&shy;ing the ma&shy;trons,
and cre&shy;at&shy;ing ma&shy;trons that were friend&shy;ly,
and good enough to be worth be&shy;friend&shy;ing.
Af&shy;ter all, the friendli&shy;est ma&shy;trons helped the haves
to write much bet&shy;ter pro&shy;grams com&shy;pared to their ad&shy;ver&shy;sar&shy;i&shy;al coun&shy;ter&shy;parts.</p>
<p>As you well know, lan&shy;guages have a pro&shy;found im&shy;pact on the way in which we think.
So do our friends. This shift in the de&shy;sign of lan&shy;guages and ma&shy;trons slow&shy;ly but
steadi&shy;ly in&shy;flu&shy;enced the kinds of pro&shy;grams be&shy;ing writ&shy;ten.
There were few&shy;er pro&shy;grams sell&shy;ing soap and the like,
and more like the ones we have to&shy;day, writ&shy;ten for a true and beau&shy;ti&shy;ful pur&shy;pose.</p>
<p>While we take the equal&shy;i&shy;ty of to&shy;day’s lan&shy;guages for grant&shy;ed,
we don’t think about the equal&shy;i&shy;ty of yes&shy;ter&shy;day’s lan&shy;guages,
even though they are the same.
If there is one thing you take away from this dis&shy;cus&shy;sion, let it be this:
all lan&shy;guages are equal, but some lan&shy;guages are more equal than oth&shy;ers.</p>
<p>Ah! The time&shy;keep&shy;er had in&shy;di&shy;cat&shy;ed that we have to ad&shy;journ now. I apol&shy;o&shy;gize for
the abrupt&shy;ness, I didn’t plan ap&shy;pro&shy;pri&shy;ate&shy;ly. Since we do not have time for
ques&shy;tions here, I’m hap&shy;py to an&shy;swer ques&shy;tions over some tea and bis&shy;cuits in the
<a href="https://github.com/theindigamer/theindigamer.github.io/issues">atri&shy;um</a>.
Thank you.</p>
