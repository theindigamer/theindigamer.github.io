They would com&amp;shy;mu&amp;shy;ni&amp;shy;cate most&amp;shy;ly by speech
– in a va&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ety of lan&amp;shy;guages, if I may add, al&amp;shy;though we’re not re&amp;shy;al&amp;shy;ly in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;est&amp;shy;ed

They would com&amp;shy;mu&amp;shy;ni&amp;shy;cate most&amp;shy;ly by speech
– in a va&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ety of lan&amp;shy;guages, if I may add, al&amp;shy;though we’re not re&amp;shy;al&amp;shy;ly in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;est&amp;shy;ed
in these here –
and pass&amp;shy;ing along these ob&amp;shy;jects with marks on them.
Of course, as you might well know, they weren’t sat&amp;shy;is&amp;shy;fied with these odd baubles
and trin&amp;shy;kets
– if they were, this would be the end and not the be&amp;shy;gin&amp;shy;ning of the sto&amp;shy;ry.
So they start&amp;shy;ed mak&amp;shy;ing wid&amp;shy;gets, and soon enough,
the biobots were in&amp;shy;fin&amp;shy;ite&amp;shy;ly charmed,
and thought these new&amp;shy;fan&amp;shy;gled thinga&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;jigs to be ir&amp;shy;re&amp;shy;place&amp;shy;able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These wid&amp;shy;gets were fast but not bright.
By “not bright” I mean not in&amp;shy;tel&amp;shy;li&amp;shy;gent, not lack&amp;shy;ing lu&amp;shy;mi&amp;shy;nos&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ty.
While this is not a tale of ro&amp;shy;mance,
do per&amp;shy;mit me to use a cliché from the genre here and claim that
the cause of this ex&amp;shy;u&amp;shy;ber&amp;shy;ant af&amp;shy;fec&amp;shy;tion was
the op&amp;shy;pos&amp;shy;ing na&amp;shy;ture of the users and the used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the wid&amp;shy;gets were fast but not bright, the lan&amp;shy;guages used by the biobots,
full of im&amp;shy;plic&amp;shy;it as&amp;shy;sump&amp;shy;tions and high&amp;shy;ly sen&amp;shy;si&amp;shy;tive to con&amp;shy;text,
were quite un&amp;shy;suit&amp;shy;able for is&amp;shy;su&amp;shy;ing tasks to the wid&amp;shy;gets.
So they made new lan&amp;shy;guages, by thought&amp;shy;ful de&amp;shy;sign,
not by ran&amp;shy;dom al&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;ations to ex&amp;shy;ist&amp;shy;ing ones.
A dis&amp;shy;tin&amp;shy;guish&amp;shy;ing fea&amp;shy;ture of these new lan&amp;shy;guages was that
they had rel&amp;shy;a&amp;shy;tive&amp;shy;ly rigid syn&amp;shy;tax.
Con&amp;shy;se&amp;shy;quent&amp;shy;ly, it didn’t mat&amp;shy;ter if a biobot had speech (writ&amp;shy;ing) im&amp;shy;ped&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ments
(or was a non-na&amp;shy;tive speak&amp;shy;er [or from an&amp;shy;oth&amp;shy;er city {sub&amp;shy;urb}]);
the need for cor&amp;shy;rect pro&amp;shy;nun&amp;shy;ci&amp;shy;a&amp;shy;tion and spell&amp;shy;ing, apart from a hand&amp;shy;ful
of mag&amp;shy;ic words, had been ob&amp;shy;vi&amp;shy;at&amp;shy;ed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must be think&amp;shy;ing, “This must’ve split the so&amp;shy;ci&amp;shy;ety in&amp;shy;to haves and have-nots,
no? Af&amp;shy;ter all, not ev&amp;shy;ery&amp;shy;one must’ve liked the new lan&amp;shy;guages, school&amp;shy;ing, wid&amp;shy;gets
et cetera.”, and you would be ab&amp;shy;so&amp;shy;lute&amp;shy;ly right.
Since there was a sig&amp;shy;nif&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cant de&amp;shy;par&amp;shy;ture from the ar&amp;shy;bi&amp;shy;trari&amp;shy;ness/flex&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;bil&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ty of
the so-called “nat&amp;shy;u&amp;shy;ral” lan&amp;shy;guages
– the two be&amp;shy;ing op&amp;shy;po&amp;shy;site sides of the same coin –
there were a large num&amp;shy;ber of have-nots.
This isn’t a tale about com&amp;shy;mu&amp;shy;nism,
so it suf&amp;shy;fices to say that there were many oth&amp;shy;er rea&amp;shy;sons why there were haves
and have-nots.
How&amp;shy;ev&amp;shy;er, in due time, the por&amp;shy;tion of have-nots re&amp;shy;duced.
So we shall fo&amp;shy;cus on the sto&amp;shy;ry of the haves here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the new lan&amp;shy;guages were be&amp;shy;ing cre&amp;shy;at&amp;shy;ed, a wise biobot sug&amp;shy;gest&amp;shy;ed that all of
them ought to be equal in some pre&amp;shy;cise sense of the word equal.
While that biobot died for quite un&amp;shy;re&amp;shy;lat&amp;shy;ed but none&amp;shy;the&amp;shy;less trag&amp;shy;ic rea&amp;shy;sons,
this sug&amp;shy;ges&amp;shy;tion was hearti&amp;shy;ly tak&amp;shy;en up by the rest and they sought to make most,
if not all, new lan&amp;shy;guages equal in this sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a short span of time, there emerged a zoo of lan&amp;shy;guages,
some wilder than oth&amp;shy;ers.
The wild lan&amp;shy;guages of&amp;shy;ten in&amp;shy;duced a cer&amp;shy;tain un&amp;shy;in&amp;shy;tel&amp;shy;li&amp;shy;gi&amp;shy;ble mad&amp;shy;ness (mad&amp;shy;ness&amp;shy;es?)
in the wid&amp;shy;gets if some thought&amp;shy;less ut&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;ance was made by the us&amp;shy;er.
The more civ&amp;shy;il lan&amp;shy;guages came with ma&amp;shy;trons,
whose sole task was to en&amp;shy;force or&amp;shy;der&amp;shy;li&amp;shy;ness,
in an ef&amp;shy;fort to pre&amp;shy;vent the afore&amp;shy;men&amp;shy;tioned thought&amp;shy;less&amp;shy;ness from run&amp;shy;ning ram&amp;shy;pant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the biobots’ writ&amp;shy;ings at the time don’t seem to in&amp;shy;di&amp;shy;cate that
they were aware of this, it is quite clear to us schol&amp;shy;ars to&amp;shy;day that
these ma&amp;shy;trons were made in the im&amp;shy;age of the biobots them&amp;shy;selves,
and that their re&amp;shy;la&amp;shy;tion to the syn&amp;shy;thet&amp;shy;ic lan&amp;shy;guage texts
– which I hence&amp;shy;forth will re&amp;shy;fer to as pro&amp;shy;grams,
for brevi&amp;shy;ty and his&amp;shy;tor&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal ac&amp;shy;cu&amp;shy;ra&amp;shy;cy –
and their au&amp;shy;thors was not un&amp;shy;like that of the biobots to&amp;shy;wards the biotots.
Let me elab&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some biobots were care&amp;shy;free and did not mind if their biotots in&amp;shy;gest&amp;shy;ed some earth
or ad&amp;shy;he&amp;shy;sives. Some were more vig&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;lant; they would ad&amp;shy;mon&amp;shy;ish the younglings if
any&amp;shy;thing “wrong” hap&amp;shy;pened, al&amp;shy;though oft with&amp;shy;out ra&amp;shy;tio&amp;shy;nale.
Then there were oth&amp;shy;ers, who would take the ef&amp;shy;fort to sug&amp;shy;gest cor&amp;shy;rec&amp;shy;tive mea&amp;shy;sures.
And of course, there were the ones with ex&amp;shy;pec&amp;shy;ta&amp;shy;tions of per&amp;shy;fec&amp;shy;tion and on&amp;shy;ly
per&amp;shy;fec&amp;shy;tion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can imag&amp;shy;ine what the cor&amp;shy;re&amp;shy;spond&amp;shy;ing ma&amp;shy;trons would look like.
Some would hold your hand, speak&amp;shy;ing metaphor&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal&amp;shy;ly of course, al&amp;shy;though there
were most cer&amp;shy;tain&amp;shy;ly wid&amp;shy;gets which would do that, and a lot more,
if you in&amp;shy;fer what I mean, but get&amp;shy;ting back to the point,
some would hold you hand where&amp;shy;as some would push you down a cliff with a
glee&amp;shy;ful smile.
Tan&amp;shy;gen&amp;shy;tial&amp;shy;ly, it is in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;est&amp;shy;ing to note an apho&amp;shy;rism pop&amp;shy;u&amp;shy;lar at the time:
do not as&amp;shy;sume mal&amp;shy;ice that which can be ex&amp;shy;plained by ig&amp;shy;no&amp;shy;rance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you per&amp;shy;mit me to wax lyri&amp;shy;cal for a bit:
from nim&amp;shy;ble to glacial, from high&amp;shy;ly dumb to high&amp;shy;ly math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;mat&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal,
from help&amp;shy;ful to dead&amp;shy;ly, from hubris&amp;shy;tic to hum&amp;shy;ble
and from worth&amp;shy;less to all-pow&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;ful, there was the en&amp;shy;tire spec&amp;shy;trum.
As is clear, this pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od had quite the di&amp;shy;ver&amp;shy;si&amp;shy;ty in lan&amp;shy;guages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the have-nots con&amp;shy;demned the haves for ex&amp;shy;ces&amp;shy;sive in&amp;shy;dul&amp;shy;gence,
be&amp;shy;wil&amp;shy;dered by the ex&amp;shy;is&amp;shy;tence of so many flavours of equal,
the haves spent nights and weeks and months and years and decades de&amp;shy;bat&amp;shy;ing
the same old de&amp;shy;bates, need&amp;shy;less&amp;shy;ly and cease&amp;shy;less&amp;shy;ly rein&amp;shy;vent&amp;shy;ing the past.
“To what end?”, you might ask. And again, you’d be right. To what end?
As far as we can tell, a lot of pro&amp;shy;grams, re&amp;shy;gard&amp;shy;less of lan&amp;shy;guage,
were be&amp;shy;ing writ&amp;shy;ten sim&amp;shy;ply to sell soap and the like,
and to re&amp;shy;di&amp;shy;rect biobots to buy&amp;shy;ing soap and the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be feel&amp;shy;ing a lit&amp;shy;tle bit vi&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;lat&amp;shy;ed now, “Soap and the like?
Sure&amp;shy;ly you’re jok&amp;shy;ing, mis&amp;shy;ter!” and you’d be right in feel&amp;shy;ing so.
Alas! His&amp;shy;to&amp;shy;ry doesn’t know, and hence fol&amp;shy;low, the wis&amp;shy;dom of the fu&amp;shy;ture.
A lot of bright biobots
– again, I am talk&amp;shy;ing about in&amp;shy;tel&amp;shy;li&amp;shy;gence here, not lu&amp;shy;mi&amp;shy;nos&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ty –
spent their en&amp;shy;tire lives writ&amp;shy;ing pro&amp;shy;grams that sold or di&amp;shy;rect&amp;shy;ed biobots
to oth&amp;shy;er pro&amp;shy;grams that sold soap and the like.
About the ter&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ble taste&amp;shy;less&amp;shy;ness of this busi&amp;shy;ness,
I would like to speak no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; like to speak about is how the sta&amp;shy;tus quo changed.
It is an in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;est&amp;shy;ing lit&amp;shy;tle sub&amp;shy;sto&amp;shy;ry, bet&amp;shy;ter dis&amp;shy;cussed here rather in the
foot&amp;shy;notes. Over a pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od of sev&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;al decades, there were mul&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;ple in&amp;shy;stances
where ma&amp;shy;jor fi&amp;shy;nan&amp;shy;cial in&amp;shy;sti&amp;shy;tu&amp;shy;tions were conned out of ridicu&amp;shy;lous sums of
cur&amp;shy;ren&amp;shy;cy. Yes, I’m talk&amp;shy;ing about the con&amp;shy;cur&amp;shy;ren&amp;shy;cy cri&amp;shy;sis.
In this time of his&amp;shy;to&amp;shy;ry, more than any oth&amp;shy;er time since or pri&amp;shy;or,
there were large mi&amp;shy;gra&amp;shy;tions of the haves from the old lan&amp;shy;guages to what were
the prim&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;tive ver&amp;shy;sions of the log&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal lan&amp;shy;guages we all know and ad&amp;shy;mire to&amp;shy;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Af&amp;shy;ter the con&amp;shy;cur&amp;shy;ren&amp;shy;cy cri&amp;shy;sis,
a lot of the haves re&amp;shy;al&amp;shy;ized the sig&amp;shy;nif&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cance of be&amp;shy;friend&amp;shy;ing the ma&amp;shy;trons,
and cre&amp;shy;at&amp;shy;ing ma&amp;shy;trons that were friend&amp;shy;ly,
and good enough to be worth be&amp;shy;friend&amp;shy;ing.
Af&amp;shy;ter all, the friendli&amp;shy;est ma&amp;shy;trons helped the haves
to write much bet&amp;shy;ter pro&amp;shy;grams com&amp;shy;pared to their ad&amp;shy;ver&amp;shy;sar&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;al coun&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you well know, lan&amp;shy;guages have a pro&amp;shy;found im&amp;shy;pact on the way in which we think.
So do our friends. This shift in the de&amp;shy;sign of lan&amp;shy;guages and ma&amp;shy;trons slow&amp;shy;ly but
steadi&amp;shy;ly in&amp;shy;flu&amp;shy;enced the kinds of pro&amp;shy;grams be&amp;shy;ing writ&amp;shy;ten.
There were few&amp;shy;er pro&amp;shy;grams sell&amp;shy;ing soap and the like,
and more like the ones we have to&amp;shy;day, writ&amp;shy;ten for a true and beau&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;ful pur&amp;shy;pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we take the equal&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ty of to&amp;shy;day’s lan&amp;shy;guages for grant&amp;shy;ed,
we don’t think about the equal&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ty of yes&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;day’s lan&amp;shy;guages,
even though they are the same.
If there is one thing you take away from this dis&amp;shy;cus&amp;shy;sion, let it be this:
all lan&amp;shy;guages are equal, but some lan&amp;shy;guages are more equal than oth&amp;shy;ers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah! The time&amp;shy;keep&amp;shy;er had in&amp;shy;di&amp;shy;cat&amp;shy;ed that we have to ad&amp;shy;journ now. I apol&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;gize for
the abrupt&amp;shy;ness, I didn’t plan ap&amp;shy;pro&amp;shy;pri&amp;shy;ate&amp;shy;ly. Since we do not have time for
ques&amp;shy;tions here, I’m hap&amp;shy;py to an&amp;shy;swer ques&amp;shy;tions over some tea and bis&amp;shy;cuits in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/theindigamer/theindigamer.github.io/issues"&gt;atri&amp;shy;um&lt;/a&gt;.
Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

with a baguette that she just bought from the gro&amp;shy;cery store. Near&amp;shy;ing the
house, she saw a small fig&amp;shy;ure hud&amp;shy;dled un&amp;shy;der the street&amp;shy;lamp, shiv&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;ing in
the cold. On ap&amp;shy;proach&amp;shy;ing close, the math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian rec&amp;shy;og&amp;shy;nize the fig&amp;shy;ure
as be&amp;shy;ing 0, so she called out, “Hey 0! What are you do&amp;shy;ing out here, all
alone in the cold by your&amp;shy;self? You’ll get frost&amp;shy;bite if you stay here all
night.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 replied, “Well, I don’t know any&amp;shy;body, so I don’t have any&amp;shy;where to go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian was puz&amp;shy;zled. She was al&amp;shy;ready feel&amp;shy;ing cold from
stand&amp;shy;ing still; be&amp;shy;ing a kind spir&amp;shy;it, she made an of&amp;shy;fer, “Why don’t you
come over to my place for the night?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 hap&amp;shy;pi&amp;shy;ly agreed to the sug&amp;shy;ges&amp;shy;tion. So they head&amp;shy;ed back to the
math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian’s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re&amp;shy;mov&amp;shy;ing her jack&amp;shy;et, the math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian went in&amp;shy;to the kitchen and lit the
stove to make some hot choco&amp;shy;late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0 walked in slow&amp;shy;ly be&amp;shy;hind, and took up one of the small chairs. The
math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian did not like small talk, so she did not make any. 0 just
stared dream&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ly through the kitchen win&amp;shy;dow. In a short while, the hot
choco&amp;shy;late was ready. The math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian poured it in&amp;shy;to a cou&amp;shy;ple of mugs
and set them on the quaint din&amp;shy;ing ta&amp;shy;ble, “There we go.” Just as she was
about to take a seat her&amp;shy;self, the door&amp;shy;bell rang. “Well, that’s
strange…I won&amp;shy;der who it could be at this time of the night…,” she
thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she opened the door, she rec&amp;shy;og&amp;shy;nized 1. 1 spoke very hur&amp;shy;ried&amp;shy;ly,”0 was
the on&amp;shy;ly num&amp;shy;ber I know and 0 was not out&amp;shy;side…I must be with 0.” The
math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian was a bit per&amp;shy;plexed but she let 1 come in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As 1 sat on a chair be&amp;shy;side 0, the math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian saw that one of the hot
choco&amp;shy;late mugs had been emp&amp;shy;tied, rinsed and was dry&amp;shy;ing on the kitchen
rack. She was slight&amp;shy;ly tak&amp;shy;en aback, but the poor sight of 1 still
shiv&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;ing from the cold made her feel bad, so she said, “Hey 1. I have a
mug of hot choco&amp;shy;late left, you could have a half of it if you like…” 1
grate&amp;shy;ful&amp;shy;ly ac&amp;shy;cept&amp;shy;ed the of&amp;shy;fer, so she split the one mug of hot choco&amp;shy;late
equal&amp;shy;ly in&amp;shy;to the two mugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as she was about to take a seat, the door&amp;shy;bell rang again. This
time, she was less sur&amp;shy;prised. As she opened the door, she was not
sur&amp;shy;prised as 2 spoke in a hur&amp;shy;ried fash&amp;shy;ion, not un&amp;shy;like 1, “Hey, could you
take me in? … 0 and 1 are the on&amp;shy;ly two num&amp;shy;bers I know and they weren’t
out&amp;shy;side … I must be with them.” The math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian rolled her eyes,
“Yeah, come in.” She went in, split the hot choco&amp;shy;late from the half-full
mug in&amp;shy;to two, hand&amp;shy;ed one of the mugs to 2, and head&amp;shy;ed back to the door.
As she opened the door, she saw 3 tak&amp;shy;en aback slight&amp;shy;ly. She said, “Oh,
come on in, I was ex&amp;shy;pect&amp;shy;ing you.” Again she went in, split the hot
choco&amp;shy;late in&amp;shy;to two and head back to the door. She was get&amp;shy;ting a bad
feel&amp;shy;ing that there wouldn’t be any left for her in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True enough, af&amp;shy;ter a cer&amp;shy;tain while, her house was crowd&amp;shy;ed with num&amp;shy;bers.
As she hand&amp;shy;ed out the mug to 76 – who had just come in – 76 ex&amp;shy;claimed,
“But there isn’t even an atom of hot choco&amp;shy;late in here!” The
math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian was pissed, “Well, you can take it or leave it. Hav&amp;shy;ing
some par&amp;shy;tial atom is prob&amp;shy;a&amp;shy;bly bet&amp;shy;ter than the emp&amp;shy;ty mug that will be
left in the end for me.” 76 was as&amp;shy;ton&amp;shy;ished by her rude&amp;shy;ness; none&amp;shy;the&amp;shy;less,
the mug hand&amp;shy;ed by her was prompt&amp;shy;ly emp&amp;shy;tied, rinsed and put back to dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De&amp;shy;spite there be&amp;shy;ing an ev&amp;shy;er de&amp;shy;creas&amp;shy;ing amount of hot choco&amp;shy;late, the
num&amp;shy;bers didn’t stop com&amp;shy;ing. They al&amp;shy;ways had the same ex&amp;shy;cuse, “I on&amp;shy;ly
know so and so and none of them are out&amp;shy;side … I must be with them.”
Af&amp;shy;ter a cer&amp;shy;tain while, there were just too many num&amp;shy;bers to fit in the
house, so the math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian start&amp;shy;ed putting them all in&amp;shy;side her trusty
lit&amp;shy;tle lap&amp;shy;top, so that she wouldn’t lose them. How&amp;shy;ev&amp;shy;er, even the lap&amp;shy;top
ran out of stor&amp;shy;age space af&amp;shy;ter a while. Af&amp;shy;ter think&amp;shy;ing for a while, the
math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian came up with a clever so&amp;shy;lu&amp;shy;tion; she pulled out her
note&amp;shy;book and wrote the fol&amp;shy;low&amp;shy;ing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She did not want to write down all of them – oth&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;wise the pa&amp;shy;per would
run out of space with few&amp;shy;er num&amp;shy;bers than the com&amp;shy;put&amp;shy;er – so she used the
&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; to rep&amp;shy;re&amp;shy;sent that she knew and un&amp;shy;der&amp;shy;stood the rest. At the
mo&amp;shy;ment she fin&amp;shy;ished writ&amp;shy;ing this down, the re&amp;shy;main&amp;shy;ing lit&amp;shy;tle hot
choco&amp;shy;late van&amp;shy;ished and the door&amp;shy;bell stopped ring&amp;shy;ing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian was tired. She hadn’t had any&amp;shy;thing to eat or drink
since get&amp;shy;ting back and now the hot choco&amp;shy;late was gone. She did not want
to go to bed on an emp&amp;shy;ty stom&amp;shy;ach; so she sliced the baguette in half,
took out a jar of mar&amp;shy;malade from the shelf above the kitchen counter,
and took a seat at the now qui&amp;shy;et din&amp;shy;ing ta&amp;shy;ble. As she was about to start
spread&amp;shy;ing the mar&amp;shy;malade, the door&amp;shy;bell rang again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure&amp;shy;ly she must be hal&amp;shy;lu&amp;shy;ci&amp;shy;nat&amp;shy;ing. Who else could it be at this time of
the night? The door&amp;shy;bell rang again. She weari&amp;shy;ly got up. As she cu&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ous&amp;shy;ly
opened the door, a strange fig&amp;shy;ure looked at her with ques&amp;shy;tion&amp;shy;ing eyes,
“0,1,2 etc. are the on&amp;shy;ly num&amp;shy;bers I know and they are not out&amp;shy;side … I
must be with them.” The math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian was puz&amp;shy;zled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you have a name?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ω.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Okay ω. Come on in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So ω was giv&amp;shy;en a seat and was of&amp;shy;fered half a baguette. At that mo&amp;shy;ment,
the door&amp;shy;bell rang again. An&amp;shy;oth&amp;shy;er con&amp;shy;ver&amp;shy;sa&amp;shy;tion at the door fol&amp;shy;lowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do you have a name?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I on&amp;shy;ly know 0,1,2 etc. and ω and they weren’t out&amp;shy;side … I must be
with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fig&amp;shy;ure was in&amp;shy;vit&amp;shy;ed in and of&amp;shy;fered a quar&amp;shy;ter of the baguette. Af&amp;shy;ter
that, the math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian went back to her note&amp;shy;book and wrote the
fol&amp;shy;low&amp;shy;ing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...
ω      | 0,1,...
ω+1    | 0,1,... ω
ω+2    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1
...    | ...&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as she fin&amp;shy;ished writ&amp;shy;ing, the re&amp;shy;main&amp;shy;ing quar&amp;shy;ter of the baguette
van&amp;shy;ished with a *poof*. Soon enough, the door&amp;shy;bell rang again. Hav&amp;shy;ing
been over&amp;shy;ly gen&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;ous with all her vis&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;tors, the math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian did not
have any food left in the pantry. Turn&amp;shy;ing away the next vis&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;tor seemed
too em&amp;shy;bar&amp;shy;rass&amp;shy;ing, so she lin&amp;shy;gered around the din&amp;shy;ing ta&amp;shy;ble, think&amp;shy;ing.
Af&amp;shy;ter a few sec&amp;shy;onds she drew a baguette:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; ___________
(_/_/_/_/_/_)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then she added a line to her ta&amp;shy;ble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...
ω      | 0,1,...
ω+1    | 0,1,... ω
ω+2    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1
...    | ...
ω+ω    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,...&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if by mag&amp;shy;ic, the baguette that she had drawn sud&amp;shy;den&amp;shy;ly shrunk by half
and it now looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; ______
(_/_/_/&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon enough, the door&amp;shy;bell rang again. This time, she added two more
lines to her ta&amp;shy;ble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...
ω      | 0,1,...
ω+1    | 0,1,... ω
ω+2    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1
...    | ...
ω+ω    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,...
ω+ω+1  | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,... ω+ω
ω+ω+2  | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,... ω+ω,ω+ω+1
...    | ...&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And *poof*, the re&amp;shy;main&amp;shy;ing half baguette van&amp;shy;ished too. The
math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cian knew what to do now. Ev&amp;shy;ery time that the door&amp;shy;bell would
ring, it would be suf&amp;shy;fi&amp;shy;cient to draw one more baguette and add four more
lines to the ta&amp;shy;ble. But how long could she keep on draw&amp;shy;ing baguettes?
She had to get some sleep and get back to work in the morn&amp;shy;ing. So she
thought, “Why don’t I draw all the baguettes at once?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; ___________   ___________   ___________
(_/_/_/_/_/_) (_/_/_/_/_/_) (_/_/_/_/_/_) ...&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She al&amp;shy;so added three more lines to her ta&amp;shy;ble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...
ω      | 0,1,...
ω+1    | 0,1,... ω
ω+2    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1
...    | ...
ω+ω    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,...
ω+ω+1  | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,... ω+ω
ω+ω+2  | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,... ω+ω,ω+ω+1
...    | ...
.      | .
.      | .
.      | .&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sure&amp;shy;ly, that’s the end of it!” Prompt&amp;shy;ly enough, all the drawn baguettes
van&amp;shy;ished with a *poof*. Even the &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; at the end van&amp;shy;ished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, she was too ex&amp;shy;haust&amp;shy;ed to even change her clothes; she just
hopped in&amp;shy;to bed. Snug&amp;shy;gling be&amp;shy;tween the blan&amp;shy;kets, she ad&amp;shy;just&amp;shy;ed the pil&amp;shy;low
and set the alarm for the next day, un&amp;shy;sure whether she would be able to
wake up on time. As she was able to close her eyes, the door&amp;shy;bell rang
again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh no! Not again!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She lim&amp;shy;bered out of the bed and opened the door, her eyes still
half-closed. The strange fig&amp;shy;ure at the door spoke with&amp;shy;out be&amp;shy;ing asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m Ω.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come in Ω. Would you like a baguette with some mar&amp;shy;malade?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, I haven’t even be&amp;shy;gun yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
