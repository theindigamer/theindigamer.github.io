rather than just be&amp;shy;liev&amp;shy;ing it to be true at face val&amp;shy;ue.&lt;/p&gt;
</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clar&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;fi&amp;shy;ca&amp;shy;tion (2017/13/10):&lt;/strong&gt; This post is in&amp;shy;tend&amp;shy;ed as a dis&amp;shy;cus&amp;shy;sion of
the &lt;em&gt;sub&amp;shy;text&lt;/em&gt; of the movie, not as cre&amp;shy;ative in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;pre&amp;shy;ta&amp;shy;tion. By sub&amp;shy;text,
I mean an in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;pre&amp;shy;ta&amp;shy;tion where all the points made are sup&amp;shy;port&amp;shy;ed by
ev&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;dence in the text/in the ap&amp;shy;pro&amp;shy;pri&amp;shy;ate his&amp;shy;tor&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal con&amp;shy;text of the text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have light&amp;shy;ly edit&amp;shy;ed the ar&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cle to avoid com&amp;shy;ing across as over&amp;shy;ly ar&amp;shy;ro&amp;shy;gant,
the rest is as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils" /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To&amp;shy;day morn&amp;shy;ing, while brows&amp;shy;ing my Face&amp;shy;book feed, I bumped across an im&amp;shy;age
shared via 9gag stat&amp;shy;ing a fan the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry re&amp;shy;gard&amp;shy;ing Stu&amp;shy;dio Ghi&amp;shy;b&amp;shy;li’s &lt;em&gt;Spir&amp;shy;it&amp;shy;ed
Away&lt;/em&gt; (2001). While the im&amp;shy;age I saw is lo&amp;shy;cat&amp;shy;ed
&lt;a href="https://9gag.com/gag/aRgKKq7"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I’ve copied the text be&amp;shy;low –
in case the link dies any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve al&amp;shy;ways won&amp;shy;dered why the sym&amp;shy;bol “ゆ” (said “yu”) was on the door
to the bath house. I asked my Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese teach&amp;shy;er, and he wasn’t too
sure so I did a lit&amp;shy;tle re&amp;shy;search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sym&amp;shy;bol used on the en&amp;shy;trance to 温泉 (on&amp;shy;sen) and 銭湯 (sen&amp;shy;to
[sic]), or Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese bath hous&amp;shy;es. The word “yu” is trans&amp;shy;lat&amp;shy;ed to “hot
wa&amp;shy;ter”. So, makes sense to be a bath house, yes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I did more read&amp;shy;ing. Dur&amp;shy;ing the Edo pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od, these pub&amp;shy;lic baths
be&amp;shy;came more pop&amp;shy;u&amp;shy;lar for men be&amp;shy;cause of wom&amp;shy;en who start&amp;shy;ed work&amp;shy;ing at
these com&amp;shy;mu&amp;shy;nal baths, wash&amp;shy;ing men and sell&amp;shy;ing sex. These bath hous&amp;shy;es
were called “yu&amp;shy;na baro”. The wom&amp;shy;en were known as 湯女, or “yu&amp;shy;na”.
This di&amp;shy;rect&amp;shy;ly trans&amp;shy;lates to “hot wa&amp;shy;ter wom&amp;shy;an”. So ba&amp;shy;si&amp;shy;cal&amp;shy;ly, they
were broth&amp;shy;els. Guess what the wom&amp;shy;an who ran this bath house would be
called?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ゆばば Yuba&amp;shy;ba. (trans&amp;shy;lates di&amp;shy;rect&amp;shy;ly to “hot wa&amp;shy;ter old wom&amp;shy;an”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuba&amp;shy;ba is the name of the wom&amp;shy;an who runs the bath house in Spir&amp;shy;it&amp;shy;ed
Away. If you watch Spir&amp;shy;it&amp;shy;ed Away in Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese, the fe&amp;shy;male work&amp;shy;ers are
re&amp;shy;ferred to as yu&amp;shy;na.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi&amp;shy;hi&amp;shy;ro was forced to change her name to Sen. Kin&amp;shy;da like how
strip&amp;shy;pers get names like “Can&amp;shy;dy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;カオナシ/No-Face keeps of&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ing Chi&amp;shy;hi&amp;shy;ro mon&amp;shy;ey. He “wants her”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THEN I read in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;views with Miyaza&amp;shy;ki. This was all put in
in&amp;shy;ten&amp;shy;tion&amp;shy;al&amp;shy;ly. As we all know. Miyaza&amp;shy;ki’s sto&amp;shy;ries are weaved with
dif&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ent themes and metaphors. He said he was tack&amp;shy;ling the is&amp;shy;sue of
the sex in&amp;shy;dus&amp;shy;try rapid&amp;shy;ly grow&amp;shy;ing in Japan, and the chil&amp;shy;dren be&amp;shy;ing
ex&amp;shy;posed to it such ear&amp;shy;ly ages is a prob&amp;shy;lem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be frus&amp;shy;trat&amp;shy;ing be&amp;shy;cause so much gets lost in trans&amp;shy;la&amp;shy;tion,
and peo&amp;shy;ple see it as this cute chil&amp;shy;drens [sic] movie and this
“mas&amp;shy;ter piece [sic] of an&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;tion” (which it de&amp;shy;fi&amp;shy;nate&amp;shy;ly [sic] is)
in&amp;shy;stead of the re&amp;shy;al state&amp;shy;ment that it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lit&amp;shy;tle search&amp;shy;ing shows that the same text has been cir&amp;shy;cu&amp;shy;lat&amp;shy;ing for a
while now (sur&amp;shy;prise, sur&amp;shy;prise) un&amp;shy;der var&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ous guis&amp;shy;es.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first sight, per&amp;shy;haps one might think that the the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry is be&amp;shy;liev&amp;shy;able,
as ev&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;denced by many peo&amp;shy;ple shar&amp;shy;ing and lik&amp;shy;ing it on Face&amp;shy;book (and oth&amp;shy;er
sites in the past).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-claim&lt;/strong&gt;: A cer&amp;shy;tain read&amp;shy;ing of a text should be tak&amp;shy;en se&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ous&amp;shy;ly on&amp;shy;ly if
there are one or more as&amp;shy;pects of the text can be “bet&amp;shy;ter” ex&amp;shy;plained by that
read&amp;shy;ing over any oth&amp;shy;er read&amp;shy;ing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not go&amp;shy;ing to jus&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;fy this point here. If you do not agree, then you might
want to stop read&amp;shy;ing here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claim&lt;/strong&gt;: The fan the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry above does not&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rep&amp;shy;re&amp;shy;sent au&amp;shy;tho&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;al in&amp;shy;tent, con&amp;shy;trary to the claim near the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is not con&amp;shy;sis&amp;shy;tent with the film un&amp;shy;less se&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ous cre&amp;shy;ative lib&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;ty is
tak&amp;shy;en with in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;pre&amp;shy;ta&amp;shy;tion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anal&amp;shy;y&amp;shy;sis&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For brevi&amp;shy;ty, let us call the de&amp;shy;fault hy&amp;shy;poth&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;sis – where the bath house
rep&amp;shy;re&amp;shy;sents a mere bath house as op&amp;shy;posed to a broth&amp;shy;el – the “bath house
the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try to break down the fan the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry bit-by-bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve al&amp;shy;ways won&amp;shy;dered why the sym&amp;shy;bol “ゆ” (said “yu”) was on the door
to the bath house. I asked my Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese teach&amp;shy;er, and he wasn’t too
sure so I did a lit&amp;shy;tle re&amp;shy;search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sym&amp;shy;bol used on the en&amp;shy;trance to 温泉 (on&amp;shy;sen) and 銭湯 (sen&amp;shy;to), or
Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese bath hous&amp;shy;es. The word “yu” is trans&amp;shy;lat&amp;shy;ed to “hot wa&amp;shy;ter”.
So, makes sense to be a bath house, yes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese-Eng&amp;shy;lish dic&amp;shy;tio&amp;shy;nary states that 湯 (ゆ) is a com&amp;shy;mon word
mean&amp;shy;ing (1) hot wa&amp;shy;ter, (2) hot bath; hot spring, (3) molten iron. 温泉
(on&amp;shy;sen) usu&amp;shy;al&amp;shy;ly refers to a hot spring where&amp;shy;as 銭湯 (sen&amp;shy;tō) a pub&amp;shy;lic
bath house where you pay for en&amp;shy;trance. So far so good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Then I did more read&amp;shy;ing. Dur&amp;shy;ing the Edo pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od,&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all let’s see what “Edo pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od” means. Loose&amp;shy;ly speak&amp;shy;ing,
Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese his&amp;shy;to&amp;shy;ry is di&amp;shy;vid&amp;shy;ed in&amp;shy;to pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ods based on rulers; the Edo pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od
and the fol&amp;shy;low&amp;shy;ing pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ods are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edo pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od - 1603 to 1868&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mei&amp;shy;ji pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od - 1868 to 1912&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taishō pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od - 1912 to 1928&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shōwa pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od - 1926 to 1989&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hei&amp;shy;sei pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od - 1989 to present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see the Edo pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od is not “re&amp;shy;cent his&amp;shy;to&amp;shy;ry” in that there have
been four pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ods af&amp;shy;ter it. No&amp;shy;tice that the rest of the fan the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry does
not pro&amp;shy;vide any ev&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;dence that the movie is ac&amp;shy;tu&amp;shy;al&amp;shy;ly re&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ring to the Edo
pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od, which weak&amp;shy;ens the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to write a post which men&amp;shy;tioned “red ocean”, does it
au&amp;shy;to&amp;shy;mat&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal&amp;shy;ly mean that I’m mak&amp;shy;ing a Home&amp;shy;r&amp;shy;ic ref&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;ence even though
noth&amp;shy;ing else in the post seems to sug&amp;shy;gest so? Very like&amp;shy;ly not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
these pub&amp;shy;lic baths be&amp;shy;came more pop&amp;shy;u&amp;shy;lar for men be&amp;shy;cause of wom&amp;shy;en who
start&amp;shy;ed work&amp;shy;ing at these com&amp;shy;mu&amp;shy;nal baths, wash&amp;shy;ing men and sell&amp;shy;ing
sex.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might be true – well, Wikipedia does men&amp;shy;tion this on the sen&amp;shy;tō
page with [Ci&amp;shy;ta&amp;shy;tion Need&amp;shy;ed]. For now, let’s as&amp;shy;sume that it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might ob&amp;shy;ject with the fol&amp;shy;low&amp;shy;ing: since mod&amp;shy;ern Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese bath hous&amp;shy;es
do not fea&amp;shy;ture wom&amp;shy;en help&amp;shy;ing you bathe, the pres&amp;shy;ence of wom&amp;shy;en cer&amp;shy;tain&amp;shy;ly
in&amp;shy;di&amp;shy;cates that the movie is re&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ring to the Edo pe&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;od.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that isn’t 100% true though – there are mod&amp;shy;ern bath hous&amp;shy;es
of&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ing a va&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ety of ser&amp;shy;vices
[&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sent%C5%8D#Future"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Oth&amp;shy;er bath hous&amp;shy;es with less pris&amp;shy;tine build&amp;shy;ings or set&amp;shy;tings change
in&amp;shy;to so called su&amp;shy;per sen&amp;shy;tō and try to of&amp;shy;fer a wider va&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ety of
ser&amp;shy;vices be&amp;shy;yond the stan&amp;shy;dard two or three bath&amp;shy;tubs. They may in&amp;shy;clude
a va&amp;shy;ri&amp;shy;ety of saunas, rein&amp;shy;tro&amp;shy;duce steam baths, in&amp;shy;clude jacuzzis, and
may even have a wa&amp;shy;ter slide. They may al&amp;shy;so of&amp;shy;fer ser&amp;shy;vices be&amp;shy;yond
mere cleans&amp;shy;ing, and turn in&amp;shy;to a spa, of&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ing med&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal baths,
mas&amp;shy;sages, mud baths, fit&amp;shy;ness cen&amp;shy;ters, etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s pro&amp;shy;ceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These bath hous&amp;shy;es were called “yu&amp;shy;na baro”. The wom&amp;shy;en were known as
湯女, or “yu&amp;shy;na”. This di&amp;shy;rect&amp;shy;ly trans&amp;shy;lates to “hot wa&amp;shy;ter wom&amp;shy;an”. So
ba&amp;shy;si&amp;shy;cal&amp;shy;ly, they were broth&amp;shy;els. Guess what the wom&amp;shy;an who ran this
bath house would be called?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ゆばば Yuba&amp;shy;ba. (trans&amp;shy;lates di&amp;shy;rect&amp;shy;ly to “hot wa&amp;shy;ter old wom&amp;shy;an”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “yu&amp;shy;na baro” term sounds plau&amp;shy;si&amp;shy;ble. The clos&amp;shy;est I’ve found is this
book [&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;amp;q=yunafuro"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]
men&amp;shy;tion&amp;shy;ing the term “yu&amp;shy;na&amp;shy;furo”. The trans&amp;shy;la&amp;shy;tion for “yu&amp;shy;na” is al&amp;shy;so
cor&amp;shy;rect. The broth&amp;shy;el part is au&amp;shy;to&amp;shy;mat&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal&amp;shy;ly im&amp;shy;plied by the “sell&amp;shy;ing sex”
in the pre&amp;shy;vi&amp;shy;ous line, so this doesn’t add much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “yuba&amp;shy;ba” term al&amp;shy;so sounds plau&amp;shy;si&amp;shy;ble; let’s as&amp;shy;sume it’s his&amp;shy;tor&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;cal&amp;shy;ly
ac&amp;shy;cu&amp;shy;rate (for the sake of ar&amp;shy;gu&amp;shy;ment and avoid&amp;shy;ing chas&amp;shy;ing point&amp;shy;less
ref&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;ences over ter&amp;shy;mi&amp;shy;nol&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;gy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yuba&amp;shy;ba is the name of the wom&amp;shy;an who runs the bath house in Spir&amp;shy;it&amp;shy;ed
Away. If you watch Spir&amp;shy;it&amp;shy;ed Away in Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese, the fe&amp;shy;male work&amp;shy;ers are
re&amp;shy;ferred to as yu&amp;shy;na.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, this might seem that it lends sup&amp;shy;port to the fan
the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry. How&amp;shy;ev&amp;shy;er, it doesn’t – for the bath house the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry, it is nat&amp;shy;u&amp;shy;ral
that the wom&amp;shy;en work&amp;shy;ing there be called yu&amp;shy;na and the old wom&amp;shy;an run&amp;shy;ning it
be called Yuba&amp;shy;ba (al&amp;shy;though the lat&amp;shy;ter per&amp;shy;haps be&amp;shy;trays a lack of
imag&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;na&amp;shy;tion). Since both the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ries reach the same con&amp;shy;clu&amp;shy;sions for the
nam&amp;shy;ing scheme, the names can&amp;shy;not sup&amp;shy;port any the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry over the oth&amp;shy;er.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More&amp;shy;over, Yu&amp;shy;na is a fair&amp;shy;ly com&amp;shy;mon ba&amp;shy;by name in Japan
[&lt;a href="http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/11/13/japans-top-baby-names-in-2015-will-naruto-influenced-monickers-still-reign-supreme/"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] (fn. &lt;a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).
Even though some Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese peo&amp;shy;ple don’t know how to name their ba&amp;shy;bies and
have names re&amp;shy;ject&amp;shy;ed by the gov&amp;shy;ern&amp;shy;ment
[&lt;a href="http://en.rocketnews24.com/2014/06/10/kanji-fail-japanese-parents-shocked-to-learn-their-baby-girls-name-has-inappropriate-meaning/"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;],
giv&amp;shy;en the fact that Yu&amp;shy;na is very com&amp;shy;mon and ap&amp;shy;proved by the gov&amp;shy;ern&amp;shy;ment, I
think that the in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;pre&amp;shy;ta&amp;shy;tion of “yu&amp;shy;na” as a wom&amp;shy;an in a broth&amp;shy;el is
ob&amp;shy;scure at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chi&amp;shy;hi&amp;shy;ro was forced to change her name to Sen. Kin&amp;shy;da like how
strip&amp;shy;pers get names like “Can&amp;shy;dy”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again for the sake of ar&amp;shy;gu&amp;shy;ment, sup&amp;shy;pose that Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese strip&amp;shy;pers al&amp;shy;so use
nick&amp;shy;names like those po&amp;shy;trayed in Amer&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;can me&amp;shy;dia. Sec&amp;shy;ond&amp;shy;ly, Sen doesn’t
seem like a strip&amp;shy;per’s name at all, un&amp;shy;less for some rea&amp;shy;son, all the
folks go&amp;shy;ing to the bath house are math&amp;shy;e&amp;shy;ma&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cians. Why? From the movie’s
Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese ti&amp;shy;tle, the ap&amp;shy;pro&amp;shy;pri&amp;shy;ate Kan&amp;shy;ji is 千 (Sen) which means 1000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sim&amp;shy;pler ex&amp;shy;pla&amp;shy;na&amp;shy;tion for Chi&amp;shy;hi&amp;shy;ro’s al&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;nate name (Sen: 千) is that it
is sim&amp;shy;ply a con&amp;shy;trac&amp;shy;tion of her cur&amp;shy;rent name (Chi&amp;shy;hi&amp;shy;ro: 千尋), in&amp;shy;tend&amp;shy;ed as
an in&amp;shy;nocu&amp;shy;ous nick&amp;shy;name. Name con&amp;shy;trac&amp;shy;tion to form nick&amp;shy;names is not
un&amp;shy;com&amp;shy;mon in Japan, where even Brad Pitt (ブラッドピット) is short&amp;shy;ened to
Bu&amp;shy;rapi (ブラピ). For chil&amp;shy;dren, the con&amp;shy;tract&amp;shy;ed name is usu&amp;shy;al&amp;shy;ly suf&amp;shy;fixed
with -chan, but not al&amp;shy;ways. Wikipedia gives the fol&amp;shy;low&amp;shy;ing ex&amp;shy;am&amp;shy;ple
[&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_name#Nicknames"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For ex&amp;shy;am&amp;shy;ple, a girl named Megu&amp;shy;mi may be called Ke&amp;shy;ichan or just Kei,
be&amp;shy;cause the char&amp;shy;ac&amp;shy;ter used to write the Megu&amp;shy;mi, 恵, can al&amp;shy;so be read
Kei.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ear&amp;shy;li&amp;shy;er, this name change doesn’t lend sup&amp;shy;port to the fan the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry
be&amp;shy;cause there’s a very sim&amp;shy;ple and rea&amp;shy;son&amp;shy;able ex&amp;shy;pla&amp;shy;na&amp;shy;tion for it
oth&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On to the next point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
カオナシ/No-Face keeps of&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ing Chi&amp;shy;hi&amp;shy;ro mon&amp;shy;ey. He “wants her”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does tip&amp;shy;ping ho&amp;shy;tel staff = you want to get laid? No.
No-face is a cus&amp;shy;tomer, of course, it is of&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ing mon&amp;shy;ey for ser&amp;shy;vice.
Again, this point does not lend ad&amp;shy;di&amp;shy;tion&amp;shy;al sup&amp;shy;port to the fan the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry be&amp;shy;cause
it works equal&amp;shy;ly well with the bath house the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
THEN I read in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;views with Miyaza&amp;shy;ki. This was all put in
in&amp;shy;ten&amp;shy;tion&amp;shy;al&amp;shy;ly. As we all know. Miyaza&amp;shy;ki’s sto&amp;shy;ries are weaved with
dif&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ent themes and metaphors. He said he was tack&amp;shy;ling the is&amp;shy;sue of
the sex in&amp;shy;dus&amp;shy;try rapid&amp;shy;ly grow&amp;shy;ing in Japan, and the chil&amp;shy;dren be&amp;shy;ing
ex&amp;shy;posed to it such ear&amp;shy;ly ages is a prob&amp;shy;lem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, be&amp;shy;ing a 9gag im&amp;shy;age, it lacks ci&amp;shy;ta&amp;shy;tions. While I’m un&amp;shy;able to
find the ac&amp;shy;tu&amp;shy;al in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;view where this point is men&amp;shy;tioned, sev&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;al
dif&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ent sites point to this source
[&lt;a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WMG/SpiritedAway"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Quote from Miyaza&amp;shy;ki: “I think the most ap&amp;shy;pro&amp;shy;pri&amp;shy;ate way to sym&amp;shy;bol&amp;shy;ize
the mod&amp;shy;ern world is the sex in&amp;shy;dus&amp;shy;try. Hasn’t Ja&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;nese so&amp;shy;ci&amp;shy;ety be&amp;shy;come
like the sex in&amp;shy;dus&amp;shy;try?”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this leaves a key ques&amp;shy;tion unan&amp;shy;swered - why does this quote
ap&amp;shy;ply to &lt;em&gt;Spir&amp;shy;it&amp;shy;ed Away&lt;/em&gt; (as seems to be claimed by the fan the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As op&amp;shy;posed to the fan the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry, there are sev&amp;shy;er&amp;shy;al sources which in&amp;shy;di&amp;shy;rect&amp;shy;ly
sup&amp;shy;port the bath house the&amp;shy;o&amp;shy;ry
[&lt;a href="http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao-miyazaki/"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]
[&lt;a href="http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/sen.html"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;]; I
rec&amp;shy;om&amp;shy;mend read&amp;shy;ing both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From [&lt;a href="http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao-miyazaki/"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;],
(pub&amp;shy;lished in Jan 2002, thus af&amp;shy;ter &lt;em&gt;Spir&amp;shy;it&amp;shy;ed Away&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you feel that the films you make are all aimed at chil&amp;shy;dren?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nev&amp;shy;er said that Por&amp;shy;co Rosso is a film for chil&amp;shy;dren, I don’t think
it is. But apart from Por&amp;shy;co Rosso, all my films have been made
pri&amp;shy;mar&amp;shy;i&amp;shy;ly for chil&amp;shy;dren. There are many oth&amp;shy;er peo&amp;shy;ple who are ca&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;ble
of mak&amp;shy;ing films for adults, so I’ll leave that up to them and
con&amp;shy;cen&amp;shy;trate on the chil&amp;shy;dren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From [&lt;a href="http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/sen.html"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;],
ti&amp;shy;tled “In&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;view: Miyaza&amp;shy;ki on Sen to Chi&amp;shy;hi&amp;shy;ro no Kamikakushi”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miyaza&amp;shy;ki: This movie is a sto&amp;shy;ry about a 10-year-old whose fa&amp;shy;ther and
moth&amp;shy;er hap&amp;shy;pened to eat some&amp;shy;thing they shouldn’t have, and so be&amp;shy;came
pigs. The movie ap&amp;shy;pears to be satire, but that isn’t my pur&amp;shy;pose. I
have five young fe&amp;shy;male friends who are about the same age as
Hi&amp;shy;ira&amp;shy;gi-san*, and I spend ev&amp;shy;ery sum&amp;shy;mer with them at my moun&amp;shy;tain
cab&amp;shy;in. I want&amp;shy;ed to make a movie they could en&amp;shy;joy. That is why I
start&amp;shy;ed this film, and that is my true pur&amp;shy;pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*HI&amp;shy;IRA&amp;shy;GI Ru&amp;shy;mi, the 13-year-old voice ac&amp;shy;tress of Chi&amp;shy;hi&amp;shy;ro. She was at
the press con&amp;shy;fer&amp;shy;ence dur&amp;shy;ing which this in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;view took place. [sic]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have made “To&amp;shy;toro,” which was for small chil&amp;shy;dren, “La&amp;shy;pu&amp;shy;ta,” in
which a boy sets out on a jour&amp;shy;ney, and “Ki&amp;shy;ki’s De&amp;shy;liv&amp;shy;ery Ser&amp;shy;vice,” in
which a teenag&amp;shy;er has to live with her&amp;shy;self. We have not made a film
for 10-year-old girls, who are in the first stage of their
ado&amp;shy;les&amp;shy;cence. So, I read the shou&amp;shy;jo man&amp;shy;ga such as Nakayoshi or Ri&amp;shy;bon
which they left at my moun&amp;shy;tain cab&amp;shy;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt this coun&amp;shy;try on&amp;shy;ly of&amp;shy;fered such things as crush&amp;shy;es and ro&amp;shy;mance
to 10-year-old girls, though, and look&amp;shy;ing at my young friends, I
felt this was not what they held dear in their hearts, not what they
want&amp;shy;ed. And so I won&amp;shy;dered if I could make a movie in which they
could be hero&amp;shy;ines…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they find this movie to be ex&amp;shy;cit&amp;shy;ing, it will be a suc&amp;shy;cess in my
mind. They can’t lie. Un&amp;shy;til now, I made “I wish there was such a
per&amp;shy;son” lead&amp;shy;ing char&amp;shy;ac&amp;shy;ters. This time, how&amp;shy;ev&amp;shy;er, I cre&amp;shy;at&amp;shy;ed a hero&amp;shy;ine
who is an or&amp;shy;di&amp;shy;nary girl, some&amp;shy;one with whom the au&amp;shy;di&amp;shy;ence can
sym&amp;shy;pa&amp;shy;thize, some&amp;shy;one about whom they can say, “Yes, it’s like that.”
It’s very im&amp;shy;por&amp;shy;tant to make it plain and un&amp;shy;ex&amp;shy;ag&amp;shy;ger&amp;shy;at&amp;shy;ed. Start&amp;shy;ing
with that, it’s not a sto&amp;shy;ry in which the char&amp;shy;ac&amp;shy;ters grow up, but a
sto&amp;shy;ry in which they draw on some&amp;shy;thing al&amp;shy;ready in&amp;shy;side them, brought
out by the par&amp;shy;tic&amp;shy;u&amp;shy;lar cir&amp;shy;cum&amp;shy;stances… I want&amp;shy;ed to tell such a sto&amp;shy;ry
in this movie. I want my young friends to live like that, and I
think they, too, have such a wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that these two in&amp;shy;ter&amp;shy;views sup&amp;shy;port part 1 of the claim and the
re&amp;shy;main&amp;shy;ing ar&amp;shy;gu&amp;shy;ments sup&amp;shy;port part 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd&gt;Yes, I re&amp;shy;alise that the list is for 2015 where&amp;shy;as the movie re&amp;shy;leased
in 2001 but I don’t think that af&amp;shy;fects the ar&amp;shy;gu&amp;shy;ment much and I was
un&amp;shy;for&amp;shy;tu&amp;shy;nate&amp;shy;ly un&amp;shy;able to find old&amp;shy;er sta&amp;shy;tis&amp;shy;tics for 2001. I al&amp;shy;so
haven’t used the 2013 sta&amp;shy;tis&amp;shy;tics (linked in that ar&amp;shy;ti&amp;shy;cle) be&amp;shy;cause it
has the name Yuina on top (which you can see is bunched to&amp;shy;geth&amp;shy;er with
Yu&amp;shy;na in 2013) and I didn’t want to go in&amp;shy;to this point in ex&amp;shy;ces&amp;shy;sive
