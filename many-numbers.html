<p>On a dark, win&shy;ter evening, a math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian was walk&shy;ing down back home,
with a baguette that she just bought from the gro&shy;cery store. Near&shy;ing the
house, she saw a small fig&shy;ure hud&shy;dled un&shy;der the street&shy;lamp, shiv&shy;er&shy;ing in
the cold. On ap&shy;proach&shy;ing close, the math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian rec&shy;og&shy;nize the fig&shy;ure
as be&shy;ing 0, so she called out, “Hey 0! What are you do&shy;ing out here, all
alone in the cold by your&shy;self? You’ll get frost&shy;bite if you stay here all
night.”</p>
<p>0 replied, “Well, I don’t know any&shy;body, so I don’t have any&shy;where to go.”</p>
<p>The math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian was puz&shy;zled. She was al&shy;ready feel&shy;ing cold from
stand&shy;ing still; be&shy;ing a kind spir&shy;it, she made an of&shy;fer, “Why don’t you
come over to my place for the night?”</p>
<p>0 hap&shy;pi&shy;ly agreed to the sug&shy;ges&shy;tion. So they head&shy;ed back to the
math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian’s house.</p>
<p>Re&shy;mov&shy;ing her jack&shy;et, the math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian went in&shy;to the kitchen and lit the
stove to make some hot choco&shy;late.</p>
<p>0 walked in slow&shy;ly be&shy;hind, and took up one of the small chairs. The
math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian did not like small talk, so she did not make any. 0 just
stared dream&shy;i&shy;ly through the kitchen win&shy;dow. In a short while, the hot
choco&shy;late was ready. The math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian poured it in&shy;to a cou&shy;ple of mugs
and set them on the quaint din&shy;ing ta&shy;ble, “There we go.” Just as she was
about to take a seat her&shy;self, the door&shy;bell rang. “Well, that’s
strange…I won&shy;der who it could be at this time of the night…,” she
thought.</p>
<p>As she opened the door, she rec&shy;og&shy;nized 1. 1 spoke very hur&shy;ried&shy;ly,”0 was
the on&shy;ly num&shy;ber I know and 0 was not out&shy;side…I must be with 0.” The
math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian was a bit per&shy;plexed but she let 1 come in.</p>
<p>As 1 sat on a chair be&shy;side 0, the math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian saw that one of the hot
choco&shy;late mugs had been emp&shy;tied, rinsed and was dry&shy;ing on the kitchen
rack. She was slight&shy;ly tak&shy;en aback, but the poor sight of 1 still
shiv&shy;er&shy;ing from the cold made her feel bad, so she said, “Hey 1. I have a
mug of hot choco&shy;late left, you could have a half of it if you like…” 1
grate&shy;ful&shy;ly ac&shy;cept&shy;ed the of&shy;fer, so she split the one mug of hot choco&shy;late
equal&shy;ly in&shy;to the two mugs.</p>
<p>Just as she was about to take a seat, the door&shy;bell rang again. This
time, she was less sur&shy;prised. As she opened the door, she was not
sur&shy;prised as 2 spoke in a hur&shy;ried fash&shy;ion, not un&shy;like 1, “Hey, could you
take me in? … 0 and 1 are the on&shy;ly two num&shy;bers I know and they weren’t
out&shy;side … I must be with them.” The math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian rolled her eyes,
“Yeah, come in.” She went in, split the hot choco&shy;late from the half-full
mug in&shy;to two, hand&shy;ed one of the mugs to 2, and head&shy;ed back to the door.
As she opened the door, she saw 3 tak&shy;en aback slight&shy;ly. She said, “Oh,
come on in, I was ex&shy;pect&shy;ing you.” Again she went in, split the hot
choco&shy;late in&shy;to two and head back to the door. She was get&shy;ting a bad
feel&shy;ing that there wouldn’t be any left for her in a while.</p>
<p>True enough, af&shy;ter a cer&shy;tain while, her house was crowd&shy;ed with num&shy;bers.
As she hand&shy;ed out the mug to 76 – who had just come in – 76 ex&shy;claimed,
“But there isn’t even an atom of hot choco&shy;late in here!” The
math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian was pissed, “Well, you can take it or leave it. Hav&shy;ing
some par&shy;tial atom is prob&shy;a&shy;bly bet&shy;ter than the emp&shy;ty mug that will be
left in the end for me.” 76 was as&shy;ton&shy;ished by her rude&shy;ness; none&shy;the&shy;less,
the mug hand&shy;ed by her was prompt&shy;ly emp&shy;tied, rinsed and put back to dry.</p>
<p>De&shy;spite there be&shy;ing an ev&shy;er de&shy;creas&shy;ing amount of hot choco&shy;late, the
num&shy;bers didn’t stop com&shy;ing. They al&shy;ways had the same ex&shy;cuse, “I on&shy;ly
know so and so and none of them are out&shy;side … I must be with them.”
Af&shy;ter a cer&shy;tain while, there were just too many num&shy;bers to fit in the
house, so the math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian start&shy;ed putting them all in&shy;side her trusty
lit&shy;tle lap&shy;top, so that she wouldn’t lose them. How&shy;ev&shy;er, even the lap&shy;top
ran out of stor&shy;age space af&shy;ter a while. Af&shy;ter think&shy;ing for a while, the
math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian came up with a clever so&shy;lu&shy;tion; she pulled out her
note&shy;book and wrote the fol&shy;low&shy;ing:</p>
<pre>Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...</pre>
<p>She did not want to write down all of them – oth&shy;er&shy;wise the pa&shy;per would
run out of space with few&shy;er num&shy;bers than the com&shy;put&shy;er – so she used the
<code>...</code> to rep&shy;re&shy;sent that she knew and un&shy;der&shy;stood the rest. At the
mo&shy;ment she fin&shy;ished writ&shy;ing this down, the re&shy;main&shy;ing lit&shy;tle hot
choco&shy;late van&shy;ished and the door&shy;bell stopped ring&shy;ing.</p>
<p>The math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian was tired. She hadn’t had any&shy;thing to eat or drink
since get&shy;ting back and now the hot choco&shy;late was gone. She did not want
to go to bed on an emp&shy;ty stom&shy;ach; so she sliced the baguette in half,
took out a jar of mar&shy;malade from the shelf above the kitchen counter,
and took a seat at the now qui&shy;et din&shy;ing ta&shy;ble. As she was about to start
spread&shy;ing the mar&shy;malade, the door&shy;bell rang again.</p>
<p>Sure&shy;ly she must be hal&shy;lu&shy;ci&shy;nat&shy;ing. Who else could it be at this time of
the night? The door&shy;bell rang again. She weari&shy;ly got up. As she cu&shy;ri&shy;ous&shy;ly
opened the door, a strange fig&shy;ure looked at her with ques&shy;tion&shy;ing eyes,
“0,1,2 etc. are the on&shy;ly num&shy;bers I know and they are not out&shy;side … I
must be with them.” The math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian was puz&shy;zled.</p>
<p>“Do you have a name?”</p>
<p>“ω.”</p>
<p>“Okay ω. Come on in.”</p>
<p>So ω was giv&shy;en a seat and was of&shy;fered half a baguette. At that mo&shy;ment,
the door&shy;bell rang again. An&shy;oth&shy;er con&shy;ver&shy;sa&shy;tion at the door fol&shy;lowed.</p>
<p>“Do you have a name?”</p>
<p>“I on&shy;ly know 0,1,2 etc. and ω and they weren’t out&shy;side … I must be
with them.”</p>
<p>The fig&shy;ure was in&shy;vit&shy;ed in and of&shy;fered a quar&shy;ter of the baguette. Af&shy;ter
that, the math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian went back to her note&shy;book and wrote the
fol&shy;low&shy;ing:</p>
<pre>Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...
ω      | 0,1,...
ω+1    | 0,1,... ω
ω+2    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1
...    | ...</pre>
<p>Just as she fin&shy;ished writ&shy;ing, the re&shy;main&shy;ing quar&shy;ter of the baguette
van&shy;ished with a *poof*. Soon enough, the door&shy;bell rang again. Hav&shy;ing
been over&shy;ly gen&shy;er&shy;ous with all her vis&shy;i&shy;tors, the math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian did not
have any food left in the pantry. Turn&shy;ing away the next vis&shy;i&shy;tor seemed
too em&shy;bar&shy;rass&shy;ing, so she lin&shy;gered around the din&shy;ing ta&shy;ble, think&shy;ing.
Af&shy;ter a few sec&shy;onds she drew a baguette:</p>
<pre> ___________
(_/_/_/_/_/_)</pre>
<p>Then she added a line to her ta&shy;ble</p>
<pre>Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...
ω      | 0,1,...
ω+1    | 0,1,... ω
ω+2    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1
...    | ...
ω+ω    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,...</pre>
<p>As if by mag&shy;ic, the baguette that she had drawn sud&shy;den&shy;ly shrunk by half
and it now looked like this:</p>
<pre> ______
(_/_/_/</pre>
<p>Soon enough, the door&shy;bell rang again. This time, she added two more
lines to her ta&shy;ble.</p>
<pre>Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...
ω      | 0,1,...
ω+1    | 0,1,... ω
ω+2    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1
...    | ...
ω+ω    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,...
ω+ω+1  | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,... ω+ω
ω+ω+2  | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,... ω+ω,ω+ω+1
...    | ...</pre>
<p>And *poof*, the re&shy;main&shy;ing half baguette van&shy;ished too. The
math&shy;e&shy;ma&shy;ti&shy;cian knew what to do now. Ev&shy;ery time that the door&shy;bell would
ring, it would be suf&shy;fi&shy;cient to draw one more baguette and add four more
lines to the ta&shy;ble. But how long could she keep on draw&shy;ing baguettes?
She had to get some sleep and get back to work in the morn&shy;ing. So she
thought, “Why don’t I draw all the baguettes at once?”</p>
<pre> ___________   ___________   ___________
(_/_/_/_/_/_) (_/_/_/_/_/_) (_/_/_/_/_/_) ...</pre>
<p>She al&shy;so added three more lines to her ta&shy;ble.</p>
<pre>Number | Knows
0      | Nobody
1      | 0
2      | 0,1
...    | ...
ω      | 0,1,...
ω+1    | 0,1,... ω
ω+2    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1
...    | ...
ω+ω    | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,...
ω+ω+1  | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,... ω+ω
ω+ω+2  | 0,1,... ω,ω+1,... ω+ω,ω+ω+1
...    | ...
.      | .
.      | .
.      | .</pre>
<p>“Sure&shy;ly, that’s the end of it!” Prompt&shy;ly enough, all the drawn baguettes
van&shy;ished with a *poof*. Even the <code>...</code> at the end van&shy;ished.</p>
<p>By now, she was too ex&shy;haust&shy;ed to even change her clothes; she just
hopped in&shy;to bed. Snug&shy;gling be&shy;tween the blan&shy;kets, she ad&shy;just&shy;ed the pil&shy;low
and set the alarm for the next day, un&shy;sure whether she would be able to
wake up on time. As she was able to close her eyes, the door&shy;bell rang
again.</p>
<p>“Oh no! Not again!”</p>
<p>She lim&shy;bered out of the bed and opened the door, her eyes still
half-closed. The strange fig&shy;ure at the door spoke with&shy;out be&shy;ing asked.</p>
<p>“I’m Ω.”</p>
<p>“Come in Ω. Would you like a baguette with some mar&shy;malade?”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I haven’t even be&shy;gun yet.”</p>
