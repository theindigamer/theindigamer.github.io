**Vim or Emacs?**

Neither, 
{% include icon-github.html username="syl20bnr" %} / [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/).

**I have some feedback (typos, errors, comments, suggestions etc.). Where should I submit it?**

If you have a Github account, please open an issue on this blog's repo. Otherwise, send me an email at `theindigamer15 AT gmail DOT com`. Thanks.

**Why is the blog structured unlike a traditional blog with full posts on the home page?**

Since I intend to write on a variety of topics, I think it would be better for the reader to have bird's eye view of the blog as a whole. To some extent, this should also compensate for the lack of a search bar.

**Why aren't the posts from the old Wordpress blog available here?**

While I'm happy with the reviews, many of the articles are just dull or cringe-worthy in hindsight. I was initially going to have them here but finally decided against it.

**Why is feature X (search, tags, comments etc.) missing?**

The most likely reason is that the feature is too complicated/not possible to implement (for me) using pure HTML + CSS. I don't want to use any JavaScript for the blog. Another possible reason is that the feature is available via some Jekyll plugin but Github Pages doesn't support all plugins.

However, you can directly search through the source code [here](https://github.com/theindigamer/theindigamer.github.io).

**What theme are you using?**

This is the Jekyll new theme (default). You can find the source code for it at
{% include icon-github.html username="jglovier" %} /
[jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new). 
I have made slight changes to the footer and the text is justified instead of left-aligned.
